comments:
  -	SYMRK is activated in root hairs by phosphorylation in response to the perception of NOD factors
  -	SYMRK-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) is endocytosed from the plasma membrane to intracellular puncta and affects the SYMRK signaling pathway
  - SYMRK-suppressed mutants can't form infection threads and therefore can't form functional nodules, though they do form pseudo-nodules lacking symbiotic bacteria and fungi
  - SYMRK overexpressing mutants form non-functional nodules without rhizobia
phenotype_synopsis: SYMRK is necessary for nodule organogenesis.

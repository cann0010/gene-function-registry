comments:
  - Complementation test confirms that SGR is Mendel's I locus. SGR is likely a positive regulator of pathways involved in breakdown of chlorophyll via translational or posttranslational regulation of chlorophyll degrading enzymes. The sgr loss-of-function mutation is due to lower expression of the SGR gene and a small insertion that disrupts SGR protein fuction.
phenotype_synopsis: The recessive phenotype sgr retains a high chlorophyll content during scenesence, causing cotyledons to stay green as they mature and leaves to stay green as they die.

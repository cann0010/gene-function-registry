scientific_name: Phaseolus vulgaris
gene_symbols:
  - PvSYMRK
gene_symbol_long: SYMbiosis Receptor-like Kinase
gene_model_pub_name: Phvul.002G143400
gene_model_full_id: phavu.G19833.gnm1.ann1.Phvul.002G143400
confidence: 5
curators:
  - Marlene Dorneich-Hayes
comments:
  - SYMRK is activated in root hairs by phosphorylation in response to the perception of NOD factors
  - SYMRK-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) is endocytosed from the plasma membrane to intracellular puncta and affects the SYMRK signaling pathway
  - SYMRK-suppressed mutants can't form infection threads and therefore can't form functional nodules, though they do form pseudo-nodules lacking symbiotic bacteria and fungi
  - SYMRK overexpressing mutants form non-functional nodules without rhizobia
phenotype_synopsis: SYMRK is necessary for nodule organogenesis.

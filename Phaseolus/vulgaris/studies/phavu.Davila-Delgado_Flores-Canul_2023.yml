comments:
  - PvSYMRK is activated in root hairs by phosphorylation of the T589 residue in
    response to the perception of NOD factors produced by rhizobia.
  - SYMRK labeled with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) is endocytosed
    from the plasma membrane to intracellular puncta in response to Rhizobium
    etli inoculation. The consequent redistribution affects the SYMRK signaling
    pathway.
  - Deletion of the SYMRK endocytic sorting motif YKTL and application of
    endocytosis inhibitors reduced the prevalence of SYMRK-EGFP intracellular
    puncta. Endocytosis was also negatively impacted in
    phosphorylation-deficient (T589A) and kinase-inactivated (K618E) mutants of
    SYMRK.
phenotype_synopsis: The PvSYMRK protein undergoes rhizobia-induced endocytosis
  and regulates a dependent kinase signal transduction cascade leading to
  rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis.

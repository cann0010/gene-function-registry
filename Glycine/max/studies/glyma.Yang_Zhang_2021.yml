comments:
  - Comparisons between plants exposed to different day lengths indicated that
    GmIDD was induced by short days. Overexpression of IDD induces early
    flowering in Wild-Type Arabidopsis plants and restores normal flowering time
    to late-flowering Arabidopsis mutants. Genes acted on by the IDD-encoded
    transcription factor were identified by ChIP-Seq.
phenotype_synopsis: GmIDD is induced by short days and promotes flowering in
  soy, maize, rice, and Arabidopsis.

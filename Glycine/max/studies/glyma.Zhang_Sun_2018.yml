comments:
  - Seed coat bloom, which contains allergenic hydrophobic proteins, is
    synthesized within the endocarp of seed pods and then adheres to the surface
    of the seed coat.
  - During soybean domestication, selection for the recessive mutant allele
    (Gmb1) gave rise to both the shiny no-bloom seed coat phenotype and elevated
    seed oil content.
  - A single nucleotide point mutation from C to T in the coding sequence of the
    dominant allele Glyma.13G241700 (GmB1) caused an amino acid change from
    cysteine to arginine resulting in a loss of helix protein structure.
  - Gene expression levels of B1 were significantly higher than b1 in both
    transgenic Williams82 and Arabidopsis thaliana; this finding suggests the C
    to T polymorphism between B1/b1 impacts transcription.
  - Gene expression levels of the transgenic allele B1 in developing pods, pod
    endocarp, seeds, and seed coats were positively correlated to the amount of
    seed coat bloom deposition. Additionally, the C to T polymorphism within B1
    was perfectly associated with different seed coat bloom phenotypes among 62
    accessions of GLycine soja and 240 accessions of Glycine max.
  - High B1-allele expression in transgenic Williams82 soybean plants was
    associated with reduced seed oil content relative to b1 controls.
    Overexpression of B1 downregulated fatty acid biosynthesis in seed pods,
    whereas b1-modulated upregulation of pod oil biosynthesis consequently
    elevated oil accumulation.
  - Genome-wide SNP data from 70 Bloom and 52 No-Bloom Glycine max accessions
    revealed a previously discovered seed oil QTL associated with seed coat
    bloom in the ~410 kb selective sweep region shaped by domestication,
    suggesting the B1 locus may have a pleiotropic effect on seed oil content.
phenotype_synopsis:
  - Bloom 1 (GmB1) encodes a transmembrane transporter-like protein that not
    only controls seed coat bloom but also exerts pleiotropic effects on seed
    oil content following up-regulated oil biosynthesis in pods.

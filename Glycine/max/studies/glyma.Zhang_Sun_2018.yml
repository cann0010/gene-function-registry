comments:
- Seed coat bloom, which contains allergenic hydrophobic proteins, is
  synthesized within the endocarp of seed pods and then adheres to the surface
  of the seed coat.
- During soybean domestication, selection for the recessive mutant allele (Gmb1)
  gave rise to both the shiny no-bloom seed coat phenotype and elevated seed oil
  content.
- A single nucleotide point mutation from C to T in the coding sequence of the
  dominant allele Glyma.13G241700 (GmB1) caused an amino acid change from
  cysteine to arginine resulting in a loss of helix protein structure.
- Gene expression levels of B1 were significantly higher than b1 in both
  transgenic Williams82 and Arabidopsis thaliana; this finding suggests the C to
  T polymorphism between B1/b1 impacts transcription.
- Gene expression levels of the transgenic allele B1 in developing pods, pod
  endocarp, seeds, and seed coats were positively correlated to the amount of
  seed coat bloom deposition. Additionally, the C to T polymorphism within B1
  was perfectly associated with different seed coat bloom phenotypes among 62
  accessions of GLycine soja and 240 accessions of Glycine max.
- High B1-allele expression in transgenic Williams82 soybean plants was
  associated with reduced seed oil levels relative to non-transgenic b1
  controls. Similar reductions in fatty acid levels were observed for B1
  transgenic Arabidopsis seeds relative to b1 transgenic or non-transgenic
  controls.
- Gene expression of the transcription factors GmWRI1a, GmLEC1a, GmLEC1b and
  GmABI3b, which upregulate fatty acids biosynthesis in soybean seeds and
  increase seed oil content, were measured in developing pods, pod endocarp and
  seed coat and seeds. Overexpression of B1 in Williams82 was associated with
  reductions in expression levels of all four transcription factors in
  developing pods and pod endocarp, but had no impact in developing seed coat
  and seeds, when compared to the b1-expressing PI 468916. Therefore, Bloom1
  downregulates fatty acid biosynthesis in seed pods, including the endocarp,
  but is unconnected to seed oil production within the seeds themselves.
- Genome-wide SNP data from 70 Bloom and 52 No-Bloom Glycine max accessions
  revealed a previously discovered seed oil QTL associated with seed coat bloom
  in the ~410 kb selective sweep region shaped by domestication, suggesting the
  B1 locus may have a pleiotropic effect on seed oil content.
phenotype_synopsis:
  - Bloom 1 (GmB1) encodes a transmembrane transporter-like protein that not
    only controls seed coat bloom but also exerts pleiotropic effects on seed
    oil content following up-regulated oil biosynthesis in pods.

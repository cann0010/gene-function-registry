comments:
  - is one of three SACPD genes involved in delta 9 steryol-acyl carrier protiens
  - has homology with SACPD-A and SACPD-B which are also linked to roles in increased stearic acid
  - SACPD-B and SACPD-C are both shown to increase stearic acid content in the seed when a deletion occurs in the genes
  - SACPD-A has no evidence that mutations increased stearic acid seed content
phenotype_synopsis: SACPD-C encodes for the delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase enzymeis an important gene involved in the conversion of steric acid into oleaic acid

comments:
  - GmKASI is a fatty acid synthesis enzyme involved in the conversion of sucrose into oil during seed development via elongation of ACP-bound acyl species.
phenotype_synopsis: Soybean seeds from a mutagenized plant exhibited doubled sucrose and halved oil content relative to wild type because of disruption to a Beta-Ketoacyl-Acyl Carrier Protein Synthase ortholog (GmKASI) by chromosomal translocation.

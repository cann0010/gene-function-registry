comments:
  - GmANR1 (Glyma08g06630) is 70% identical to GmANR2 (Glyma08g06640).
  - ANR1 is highly and predominantly expressed in the soybean seed coat.
  - Mutations in the ANR1 gene are associated with red-brown seed coat color as a result of reductions in soluble proanthocyanidin (PA) levels.
phenotype_synopsis: GmANR1 (Glyma08g06630) is associated with brown seed coat color through the reduction of cyanidin (a reddish-purple anthocyanidin) to (-)-epicatechin, a monomer used to build flavonoid proanthocyanidins (PAs) along with catechin.

comments:
  - The seed-coat color phenotypes Brown (O) and red-brown (o) are controlled by
    the O locus in an irT (brown) genetic background (alternative to iRT black
    background).
  - GmANR1 (Glyma08g06630) is 70% identical to GmANR2 (Glyma08g06640).
  - ANR1 is highly and predominantly expressed in the seed coat.
  - Lines associated with red-brown seed coat color showed strong decreases in
    soluble proanthocyanidin (PA) levels and small increases in anthocyanins
    relative to brown-pigmented lines.
  - Spontaneous mutant and EMS-mutagenized lines with red-brown seed coats
    exhibited reduced ANR1 gene expression in the testa and lower ANR1 activity
    in vitro, respectively.
  - ANR1 mutations that either impair gene expression or enzyme activity may
    result in a red-brown seed coat phenotype and possibly redirect cyanidin
    substrate towards enhanced anthocyanin biosynthesis.
phenotype_synopsis: GmANR1 (Glyma08g06630) produces brown seed coat color
  through the reduction of cyanidin (a reddish-purple anthocyanidin) to
  (-)-epicatechin, a monomer used to build flavonoid proanthocyanidins.

comments:
  - GmANR2 is not highly expressed within the seed coat.
  - ANR2 is expressed at low levels throughout all organs.

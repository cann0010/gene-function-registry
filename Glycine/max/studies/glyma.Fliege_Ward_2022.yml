comments:
  - silencing of the low protien version of Glyma.20g085100 increases seed protien concentration
  - controls seed protien phenotype
  - 321bp deletion found in PI 468916 determines high protien allele
  - fine mapping of the cqSeed protein-003 shows that it is found between BARCSOYSSR_20_0670 and BARCSOYSSR_20_0674
phenotype_synopsis: Glyma.20g085100 regulates seed protein content by being coincident with the causative polymorphism in cqSeed protein-003
traits:
  - entity_name: seed protien content

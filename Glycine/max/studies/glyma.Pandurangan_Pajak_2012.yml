comments:
  - strongly expressed in the seed coat of developing seeds
  - Lower transcription levels in the cotyledon compared to the seed coat
  - very low levels of transcription of ASGB1 in embryo of developing seeds
  - ASPGB1a is primarily expressed in seed coat compared to other paralougs of ASPGB1
  - Transcription levels are more highly expressed in the high protien developing seed (AC Proteus)

  - predominantly expressed in the cotyledon compared to other ASPG genes
  - Transcription levels are more highly expressed in the cotyledon of low protien seed (Maple Arrow)
  - low trancription of ASPGB2 paralougs may explain the higher free asparagine levels in the embryo of developing seeds

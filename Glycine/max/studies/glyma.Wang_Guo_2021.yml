comments:
  - Overexpression of GmSTF3 in transgenic soybeans increased nodulation, whereas RNAi knockdown decreased nodulation.
  - STF3 is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor GmCRY1 and expressed mainly in leaves.
  - The protein product of STF3 migrates from shoots to the roots and signals nodule formation.
  - After migration, STF3 is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (GmCCaMK), which is activated by rhizobial infection of the roots.
  - Phosphorylation causes GmSTF3 and GmFT2a to form a complex that subsequently activates gene expression of nodulation signaling pathway 1 (GmNSP1), nodule inception (GmNIN), and nuclear factor Y (GmNF-YA1 and GmNF-YB1).
phenotype_synopsis: Soybean TGACG-motif Binding Factor 3 (GmSTF3) promotes nodulation in conjunction with Flowering Locus T2a (GmFT2a) by inducing expression of nodule signalling pathway 1 (NSP1), nodule inception (NIN), and nuclear factor Y (NFY) genes.

comments:
  - Overexpression of GmFT2a in transgenic soybeans increased nodulation, whereas RNAi knockdown decreased nodulation.
  - FT2a is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor GmCRY1, as well as the transcription factor CONSTANS when acting as a florigen in response to long-day photoperiods.
  - FT2a is mainly expressed in leaves, and the translated product migrates from shoots to the roots in order to signal nodule formation.
  - At the roots, the FT2a protein forms a complex with the phosphorylated product of GmSTF3, which subsequently activates gene expression of nodulation signaling pathway 1 (GmNSP1), nodule inception (GmNIN), and nuclear factor Y (GmNF-YA1 and GmNF-YB1).
phenotype_synopsis: Flowering Locus T2a (GmFT2a) is known for stimulating flowering, but it also positively regulates nodule organogenesis. Together with Soybean TGACG-motif Binding Factor 3 (GmSTF3) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (GmCCaMK), GmFT2a signals the root system that adequate photosynthate is available to power the rhizobial symbiosis and nitrogen fixation.

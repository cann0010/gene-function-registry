comments:
  - Transgenic expression of LCLb2 shows that the gene maintains rhythmicity, is expressed most strongly at dawn, and is influenced by light/dark and temperature cycles.
  - The circadian cycle speeds up when the transgenic plant is exposed to higher intensity red or blue light.
  - Knockout of transcription factors LCLa1, LCLa2, LCLb1, and LCLb2 produces short circadian rhythms and delayed flowering time.
  - GmLCL genes share homology with AtCCA1, AtLHY, and VrCCA1L26 genes (see Liu_Zhang_2022.yml)

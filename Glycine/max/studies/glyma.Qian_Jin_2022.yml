comments:
  - Mutated GmBADH2 may be responsible for the aroma of three aromatic soybean
    cultivars.
  - A perfect association between the marker genotypes and aroma phenotypes
    implied that GmBADH2 is a major aroma-conferring gene

comments:
  - GmBADH1 gene may mainly regulate the salt tolerance of seedling stage
  - GmBADH2 expression level in the R6 stage seeds was significantly lower in
    the aromatic soybean varieties (QX1 and XD) than in the non-aromatic soybean
    variety (DBH), whereas there were no significant differences in the GmBADH1
    expression levels
  - Knockout of the soybean (Glycine max) betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase genes
    GmBADH1 and GmBADH2 using CRISPR/Cas12i3 enhances the aroma of soybeans
phenotype_synopsis: regulate the salt tolerance of seedling stage

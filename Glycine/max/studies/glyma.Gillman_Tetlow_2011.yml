comments:
  - impacted by R2R3 MYB transcription factor to impact the production of pigment and hilum color
  - involved in anthocyanin synthesis to produce hilum color

comments:
  - involved in upregulating the UF3GT expression, leading to brown hilum color
  - maybe involved in many other things as a transcription factor often serves multiple functions
  - is part of one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, it is likely to have more impacts
phenotype_synopsis: transcription factor that greatly impacts hilum color; as a transcription factor, it is involved with lots of color-controlling genes and genes in general to impact color. It plays and important role into the up regulation of the UF3GT gene to produce a brown hilum color.

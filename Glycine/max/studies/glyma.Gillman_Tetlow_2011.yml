comments:
  - The classical R locus is associated with brown coloration of seed coats and
    hilums.
  - A loss of function mutation altering the R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene
    GmR (Glyma09g36990) was proposed as a candidate for the brown hilum
    phenotype. Expression of this gene is specific to the seed coat.
  - Gene expression of the functional GmR gene candidate was correlated with
    expression of an UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene.
    UF3GT is responsible for the final step in anthocyanin biosynthesis.
    Conversely, gene expression of this functionless allele of Glyma09g36990 was
    associated with a failure to upregulate the UF3GT gene.
phenotype_synopsis: Gene expression of functional transcription factor GmR is
  associated with up-regulation of the UF3GT gene and consequent anthocyanin
  production.

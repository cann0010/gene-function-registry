comments:
  - SPX5 is most strongly expressed in nodules.
  - Phosphate deficiency promotes expression of SPX5 in nodules but decreases SPX5 expression in roots. Nitrogen deficiency decreased SPX5 expression in roots.
  - SPX5 is upregulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection in phosphate-deficient conditions.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of ASL6, increasing expression of ASL6 during nodule development.
phenotype_synopsis: SPX5 upregulates ASL genes to positively regulate nodule number. Unlike other SPX genes, SPX5 does not affect expression of PHR genes.

  - NF-YC4 positively regulates nodule number and nitrogenase activity.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of ASL6, increasing expression of ASL6 during nodule development.
phenotype_synopsis: NF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates ASL genes to positively regulate nodule number.

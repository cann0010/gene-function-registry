comments:
  - A positive regulator of node number and internode length, which together determine soybean height
  - rin1 may also have roles in flowering time and regional adaptation in soybean
  - rin1 is strongly expressed in the shoot axillary meristems, trifoliate leaves, shoot apical meristem, and leaf primordia
  - rin1 can interact directly with both STF1 and STF2 and promote degradation of STF1 and STF2
  - Suppresses the expression of GA2ox7a and GA2ox7b, which promotes gibberellin catabolism in the shoot apical meristem
  - rin1 improves soybean yield under high-density planting conditions compared to HN35
  - RIN1 functions might be upstream of STF1 and STF2 and partially depends on STF1 and STF2

comments:
  - soybean homoloug of Arabidopsis ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5)
  - Under normal blue light conditions, directly activates GA2ox expression, which suppress the elongation of soybean internodes
  - Under poor blue light conditions, STF1 is down regulated which promotes elogation of soybean internodes
  - rin1 can interact with STF1 and promote degregation
  - rin1 functions might be upstream of STF1 and STF2 and partially depends on STF1 and STF2
phenotype_synopsis: STF2 controls internode elgonation by regulating transcription of GA2ox7 genes

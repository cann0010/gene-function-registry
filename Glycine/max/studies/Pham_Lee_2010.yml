comments:
  - If FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B are both downregulated or have loss-of-function mutations, seeds will have high oleic acid content.
  - Knockout studies confirm that functional FAD2-1A decreases accumulation of oleic acid in seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: FAD2-1A converts the precursors of oleic acid into linoleic acid.

comments:
  - If FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B are both downregulated or have loss-of-function mutations, seeds will have high oleic acid content.
  - FAD2-1B is more active at low temperatures.
  - Knockout studies confirm that functional FAD2-1B decreases accumulation of oleic acid in seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: Normal FAD2-1B converts the precursors of oleic acid into linoleic acid.

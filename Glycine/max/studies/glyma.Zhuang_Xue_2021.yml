comments:
  - GmSPX5 is most strongly expressed in root nodules.
  - Phosphate deficiency promotes expression of SPX5 in nodules but decreases
    SPX5 expression in roots. Nitrogen deficiency decreased SPX5 expression in
    roots.
  - SPX5 is upregulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection in
    phosphate-deficient conditions.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of GmNF-YC4 to the promoter of GmASL6, increasing
    expression of ASL6 during nodule development.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSPX5 upregulates GmASL genes to positively regulate nodule
  number. Unlike other SPX genes, SPX5 does not affect expression of PHR genes.

comments:
  - GmNF-YC4 positively regulates nodule number and nitrogenase activity.
  - GmSPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of GmASL6, increasing
    expression of ASL6 during nodule development.
phenotype_synopsis: GmNF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates GmASL
  genes to positively regulate nodule number.

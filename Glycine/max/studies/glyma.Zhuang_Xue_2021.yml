comments:
  - GmSPX5 was most strongly expressed in soybean root nodules. Overexpression
    of SPX5 enhanced nodule development particularly under phosphate-sufficient
    conditions, whereas SPX5 suppression didn't cause any phenotypic
    differences.
  - Phosphorus concentration was unaffected in leaves, roots, and nodules of
    both SPX5 overexpression and suppression lines; nor was phosphate
    transporter gene expression altered in SPX5-overexpressing nodules. These
    facts contraindicate a role in phosphorus homeostasis as seen for homologous
    SPX proteins.
  - Phosphorus starvation typically inhibits nodulation in legumes. Yao, Tian et
    al. (2014) found that phosphorus deficiency promoted expression of SPX5 in
    roots and reduced expression in flowers and seeds. Conversely, SPX5
    expression in roots was very low when phosphorus availability was high.
    Nitrogen and potassium deficiencies resulted in decreased and increased SPX5
    expression in roots, respectively.
  - SPX5 expression was upregulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection
    in phosphorus-deficient conditions (Yao, Tian et al., 2014).
  - SPX5 interacts with the transcription regulator Nuclear Factor Y Subunit C4
    (GmNF-YC4) and promotes its binding to the promoter of Asparagine
    Synthetase-like Gene 6 (GmASL6), thus increasing expression of ASL6 during
    nodule development. However, nodule overexpression of SPX5 did not impact
    asparagine accumulation.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSPX5 functions alongside GmNF-YC4 to upregulate GmASL6,
  positively regulate nodule number, and adapt to phosphorus deficiencies. SPX5
  doesn't interact with or modulate expression of phosphate starvation response
  (PHR) genes involved in phosphorus homeostasis.

comments:
  - Nuclear Factor Y Subunit C4 (GmNF-YC4) positively regulates nodule number
    and nitrogenase activity.
  - Overexpression of either GmSPX5 or NF-YC4 leads to upregulation of
    Asparagine Synthetase-like Genes ASL2,3,4,5,and 6.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of GmASL6, increasing
    expression of ASL6 during nodule development and functionality of the
    asparagine synthesis pathway.
phenotype_synopsis: GmNF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates GmASL
  genes to positively regulate nodule number.

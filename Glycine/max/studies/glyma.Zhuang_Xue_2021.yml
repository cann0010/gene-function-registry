comments:
  - GmSPX5 is most strongly expressed in root nodules. Overexpression of SPX5
    enhanced nodule development particularly under phosphate-sufficient
    conditions. whereas SPX5 suppression didn't cause any phenotypic
    differences.
  - Phosphorus concentration was unaffected in leaves, roots, and nodules of
    both SPX5 overexpression and suppression lines; Nor was phosphate
    transporter gene expression altered in SPX5-overexpressing nodules. These
    facts contraindicate a role in phosphorus homeostasis as seen for other
    homologous SPX proteins.
  - Pi starvation typically inhibits nodulation in legumes. Phosphate deficiency
    promotes expression of SPX5 in nodules but decreases SPX5 expression in
    roots. Nitrogen deficiency decreased SPX5 expression in roots.
  - SPX5 is upregulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection in
    phosphate-deficient conditions.
  - SPX5 interacts with the transcription factor GmNF-YC4 and promotes its
    binding to the promoter of asparagine synthetase-like gene GmASL6,
    increasing expression of ASL6 during nodule development. However, nodule
    overexpression of SPX5 did not impact asparagine accumulation.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSPX5 upregulates GmASL genes to positively regulate nodule
  number and adapt to phosphorus deficiencies. Unlike other SPX genes, SPX5 does
  not interact with or affect expression of PHR genes involved in phosphorus
  homeostasis.

comments:
  - GmNF-YC4 positively regulates nodule number and nitrogenase activity.
  - Overexpression of either GmSPX5 or NF-YC4 leads to upregulation of
    asparagine synthase-like genes ASL2,3,4,5,and 6.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of GmASL6, increasing
    expression of ASL6 during nodule development and thus the asparagine
    synthesis pathway.
phenotype_synopsis: GmNF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates GmASL
  genes to positively regulate nodule number.

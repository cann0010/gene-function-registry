comments:
  - The effect of GmbZIP123 was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana rather than in Glycine max.
  - Overexpression of bZIP123 increased lipid content in seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis.
  - The transcription factor bZIP123 bound to the promoters and upregulated Arabidopis genes for two sucrose transporters (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertases (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6).
  - Cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were consequently boosted in Arabidopsis siliques. The result was greater levels of the sugars glucose, fructose, and sucrose within seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: GmbZIP123 is a transcription factor which promotes expression of sucrose transporter and cell-wall invertase genes. Regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds may be mediated by controlling transport of sugar into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues.

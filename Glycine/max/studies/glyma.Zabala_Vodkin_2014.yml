comments:
  - Three different alleles RM55-r^m (variegated black-brown seed coat), RM30-R* (black seed coat), and RM38-r (brown seed coat)
  - 13 kb CACTA transposable element (TgmR*) insertion found in intron 2 in RM55-r^m and RM30-R*
  - “C”-nt deletion in Exon2 found in RM38-r
  - TgmR* insertion slightly represses expression of Glyma09g36983
  - r allele of brown seed coats is expresssed at a higher level then the R* allele
  - R* allele Glyma09g36983 gene enhances expression/accumulation of ANS transcripts
  - TgmR* is stabilized by an increase of methylation in the R* line compared to the r allele line
  - TgmR* confirms the proposed existence of two subfamilies of CACTA transposons in soybean
  - ANS genes are highly expressed during early seed development stages
  - UGT78K1 gene may not be expressed in the seed coat but rather in the cotyledons

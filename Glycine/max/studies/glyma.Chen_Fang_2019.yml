comments:
  - GmSYP24 was identified as a dehydration-responsive gene with the expressed protein located on the cell membrane.
  - Overexpression of SYP24 in soybean and heteroexpression in Arabidopsis produced insensitivity to osmotic/drought stress and high salinity levels.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans had greater water content and higher activities of peroxidase and superoxide dismutase compared with non-transgenic controls following exposure to abiotic stresses.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans showed altered expression of some aquaporins under osmotic/drought, salt, or ABA treatment.
  - Leaf stomatal density and opening were reduced in SYP24-transgenic Arabidopsis, and ABA-responsive genes were up-regulated.
  - Sensitivity to ABA was decreased during seed germination of both SYP24-transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis.
phenotype_synopsis:  GmSYP24 plays an important role to enhance drought response and salt tolerance as part of the ABA signaling pathway.

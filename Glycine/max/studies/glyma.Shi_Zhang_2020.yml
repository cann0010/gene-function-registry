comments:
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established through its overexpression in soybean, which increased the number of nodules relative to the wild-type. RNA interference had no effect on nodule number.
  - DRR1 is homologous with other dirigent proteins such as GmDRR2 and GmDRR3.
  - DRR1 promotes the synthesis of (+)-pinoresinol which is needed to increase lignin biosynthesis. Higher levels of lignin content and secondary cell wall deposition function as a physical barrier and inhibit the ability of Phytophthora sojae to infect soybeans.
  - The GmNAC1 transcription factor may bind to the DRR1 promoter to upregulate DRR1 expression and enhance Phytophthora sojae resistance.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR1 was induced in soybean roots by the presence of rhizobia and helped establish a symbiotic relationship that resulted in development of root nodules and nitrogen fixation. Additionally, DRR1 expression increased the resistance of soybean to Phytophthora sojae.

comments:
  - GmDRR1 and GmDRR2 are homologous proteins. The function of DRR1 may depend on dimer formation with DRR2.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR2 promoted a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia that resulted in development of root nodules and nitrogen fixation in soybean.

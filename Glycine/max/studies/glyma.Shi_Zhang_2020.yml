comments:
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established though its overexpression in soybean, which increased the number of nodules relative to the wild-type. RNA interference had no effect on nodule number.
  - GmDRR1 is homologous with other dirigent proteins such as GmDRR2 and GmDRR3.
  - The GmNAC1 transcription factor may bind to the GmDRR1 promoter to upregulate GmDRR1 expression and enhance Phytophthora sojae resistance.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR1 was induced in soybean roots by the presence of rhizobia and helped establish a symbiotic relationship that results in development of root nodules and nitrogen fixation.  Additionally, DRR1 expression increases the resistance of soybean to Phytophthora sojae.

comments:
  - GmDRR1 and GmDRR2 are homologous. The function of DRR1 may depend on dimer formation with DRR2.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR2 promotes a symbiotic relationship that results in development of root nodules and nitrogen fixation in soybean.

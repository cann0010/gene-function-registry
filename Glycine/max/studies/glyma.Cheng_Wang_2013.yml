  - GmIFS1 is a duplicate of GmIFS2.  ### What is meant by "duplicate" here?

comments:
  - GmF3H2 is under more selective pressure than GmIFS1 & GmIFS2.
  - Only shows GmF3H name and not GmF3H2.   ### Not sure what this means?
phenotype_synopsis: Involved in flavone 3-hydroxylase synthase and involved in
  environmental stress responses.

comments:
  - Gm-lpa-TW-1 lpa (low phytic acid) mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in MIPS1
  - Gm-lpa-TW-1 had a significant increase in inorganic phosphorus levels and a decrease in organic phosphorus levels compared to the WT
phenotype_synopsis: involved in the early stages of phytic acid synthesis
traits:
  - entity_name: myo-inositol hexakisphosphate metabolic process
    entity: GO:0033517

comments:
  - the mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 on LG B2 closely linked with Satt168 and Satt 416 which puts it in the area of the palmitate QTL
  - the lpa mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 does not affect seed emergence rate or seed yield
  - Gm-lpa-ZC-2 had a increase in inorganic phosphorus levels and a decrease in organic phosphorus levels compared to the WT

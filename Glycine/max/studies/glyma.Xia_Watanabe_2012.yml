comments:
 - E1 transcripts negativly regulates the expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a
 - High levels of expression in cotyledons, fully expanded leaves and mature leaves
 - E1 expression shows a bimodel pattern under long day conditions (16h light, 8h dark), transcription slows in the dark, reaching its minimmum at dawn
 - high level of E1 expression requires long-day conditions and functional photoreceptor genes (E3 and E4)
 - E1 inhibits GmFT2a/GmFT5a expression during long day conditions
 - Supression of E1 leads to early flowering
phenotype_synopsis: E1 transcripts negativly regulates the expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a to control flowering time

comments:
  - FT2a recessive allele has a Ty1/copia–like retrotransposon (SORE-1) inserted in the first intron
  - SORE-1 only reduces FT2a by allele-specific transcriptional repression when highly methylated
  - E2 inhibits FT2a expression possibly through a pathway different from the E1–PHYA pathway
  - FT2a recessive allele ia a leaky allele and is still regulated by other genes involved in photoperiod response
phenotype_synopsis: FT2a plays a role in flowering time, as the recessive homozygous allele is associated with late flowering time

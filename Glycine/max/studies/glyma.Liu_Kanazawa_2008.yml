comments:
  - GmphyA2 has 6238-bp Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon inserted in exon 1 in the e4 allele
  - mRNA transcription of GmphyA2 is inhibited due to the retrotransposon element in e4
  - The insertion in e4 GmphyA2 is causing photoperiod insensitivity
  - Expressed in cotyledons, hypocotyls, and etiolated and green primary leaves

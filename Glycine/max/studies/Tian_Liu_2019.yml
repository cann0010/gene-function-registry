comments:
  - GmFLS2a and GmFLS2b are likely redundant. They are not distinguishable by the VIGS knockout approach. When both of these genes are silenced, soy plants became much more suceptible to bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea), but resistance to viral pathogens (Soybean mosaic virus) is not affected.
phenotype_synopsis: GmFLS2a and GmFLS2b kinases start a phosphorylation cascade that activates GmMPK3 and GmMPK6, which are involved in the plant's response to bacterial infection.

  - entity_name: bacterial disease resistance

comments:
  - Overexpression of BEHL1 decreases nodulation, RNAi knockdown of BEHL1 increases nodulation.
  - BEHL1 interacts with the nodulation factor (NF) pathway as well as the brassinosteroid signalling (BR) pathway.
  - The product of BEHL1 binds to BR-responsive Responsive Elements (BRRE) and the gene GmBIN2 to regulate BR signalling.
phenotype_synopsis: BEHL1 is a corepressor. It works with NNC1 (see Wang, Wang et. al., 2014) as a negative regulator of nodulation.

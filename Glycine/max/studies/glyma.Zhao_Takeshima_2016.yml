comments:
  - FT2a recessive allele has a Ty1/copia–like retrotransposon (SORE-1) inserted in the first intron
  - SORE-1 only reduces FT2a by allele-specific transcriptional repression when highly methylated
  - E2 inhibits FT2a expression possibly through a pathway different from the E1–PHYA pathway
  - FT2a recessive allele ia a leaky allele and is still regulated by other genes involved in photoperiod response
phenotype_synopsis: FT2a plays a role in flowering time, as the recessive homozygous allele is associated with late flowering time

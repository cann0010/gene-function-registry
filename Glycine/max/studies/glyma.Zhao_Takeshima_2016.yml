comments:
  - FT2a recessive allele has a Ty1/copia–like retrotransposon (SORE-1) inserted in the first intron
  - SORE-1 only reduces FT2a by allele-specific transcriptional repression when highly methylated
  - E2 inhibits FT2a expression possibly through a pathway different from the E1–PHYA pathway
  - FT2a recessive allele ia a leaky allele and is still regulated by other genes involved in photoperiod response
  - Further testing is needed to determine the functions of the two cis-elements or nearby unknown elements in the regulation of FT2a expression

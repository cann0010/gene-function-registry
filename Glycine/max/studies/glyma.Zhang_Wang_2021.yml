comments:
  - NNL1 encodes an R protein that interacts with nodulation outer protein P (NopP) of Bradyrhizobium japonicum to prevent symbiosis.
  - Different NNL1 alleles provide immunity to different B. japonicum symbionts.
  - GmSINE1 may be inserted into NNL1, producing an inactive truncated protein. Infection proceeds normally when NNL1 is nonfunctional.
  - NNL1 is induced by innoculation with B. japonicum and expressed in root hairs.
phenotype_synopsis: NNL1 gives soy plants immunity to root hair infection by B. japonicum, which inhibits nodulation and reduces nitrogen fixation.

comments:
  - Rj2 interacts with rhizobial NopP to determine compatibility of infecting rhizobia.
  - Different Rj2 alleles provide immunity to different Bradyrhizobium symbionts.
  - When invading NopP is incompatible with host Rj2, Rj2 activates defence gene PR-2 to prevent infection.
  - Regardless of rhizobial compatibility, Rj2 induces ENOD40.
  - Rj2 is expressed in nodules, root hairs, root tips, and shoot meristems.
phenotype_synopsis: Rj2 is a resistance gene involved in sensing compatibility between soy and Bradyrhizobium symbionts.

comments:
  - Cultivated soybean carrying the Rj2 allele restricts nodulation with
    specific Bradyrhizobium strains via host immunity, mediated by rhizobial
    type III secretory protein NopP and the host resistance protein Rj2.
  - The Rj2 gene appears to have been maintained during the process of soybean
    domestication to adapt to high rhizobial diversity.
phenotype_synopsis: The Rj2 protein mediates nodulation compatibility with rhizobial strains.

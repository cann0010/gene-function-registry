comments:
  - Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS)
  - also known as glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.13G248000.1
  - condifence is 4 because "further functional validation is required to determine
    its [Glyma.13g248000] roles in seed-flooding tolerance of soybean"
  - "GmSFT(Glyma.13g248000) was considered to be the most likely candidate gene regulating seed-flooding tolerance in soybean"

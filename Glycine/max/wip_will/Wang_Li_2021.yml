  - ncbi says the locus for  gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase 8 [Glycine max] ->
    "LOCUS NP_001242439"
  - Cannot find plant trait ontology for trailing growth and shoot length -> "shoot height (related)" is for plant height
  - glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.13G287600.1 also works
  -
phenotype_synopsis: Negatively correlated with shoot length and trailing growth

  - entity_name: plant height

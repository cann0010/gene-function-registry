comments:
  - Could not determine the gene_model_pub_name from the paper.
  Looked through other pubmed articles and found "Glyma16g08450 
  (incomplete soybean genome database sequence) appeared to encode 
  a GmGBP1 transcription factor ortholog." in the paper 
  "Overexpression of a GmGBP1 ortholog of soybean enhances 
  the responses to flowering, stem elongation and heat tolerance 
  in transgenic tobaccos"... glyma.Wm82.gnm1.ann1.Glyma16g08450.2
  - However, when I took the gene to the NCBI Protein finder 
  the gene came up as "MADS-box protein FULc [Glycine max]"". And by 
  running Funnotate I got different gene_model_full_ids.
  - haplotype analysis, association analysis, phenotypic analysis, statistics analysis
  - on ncbi -> GLYMA_01G008600v4 , LOC732608, glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.01G008600.1

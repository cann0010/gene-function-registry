AB  - E10 is a new maturity locus in soybean and FT4 is the predicted/potential 
      functional gene underlying the locus. Flowering and maturity time traits play 
      crucial roles in economic soybean production. Early maturity is critical for 
      north and west expansion of soybean in Canada. To date, 11 genes/loci have been 
      identified which control time to flowering and maturity; however, the molecular 
      bases of almost half of them are not yet clear. We have identified a new maturity 
      locus called "E10" located at the end of chromosome Gm08. The gene symbol E10e10 
      has been approved by the Soybean Genetics Committee. The e10e10 genotype results 
      in 5-10 days earlier maturity than E10E10. A set of presumed E10E10 and e10e10 
      genotypes was used to identify contrasting SSR and SNP haplotypes. These 
      haplotypes, and their association with maturity, were maintained through five 
      backcross generations. A functional genomics approach using a predicted 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) approach (Protein-protein Interaction 
      Prediction Engine, PIPE) was used to investigate approximately 75 genes located 
      in the genomic region that SSR and SNP analyses identified as the location of the 
      E10 locus. The PPI analysis identified FT4 as the most likely candidate gene 
      underlying the E10 locus. Sequence analysis of the two FT4 alleles identified 
      three SNPs, in the 5'UTR, 3'UTR and fourth exon in the coding region, which 
      result in differential mRNA structures. Allele-specific markers were developed 
      for this locus and are available for soybean breeders to efficiently develop 
      earlier maturing cultivars using molecular marker assisted breeding.

AB  - Soybean is a major legume crop originating in temperate regions, and photoperiod 
      responsiveness is a key factor in its latitudinal adaptation. Varieties from 
      temperate regions introduced to lower latitudes mature early and have extremely 
      low grain yields. Introduction of the long-juvenile (LJ) trait extends the 
      vegetative phase and improves yield under short-day conditions, thereby enabling 
      expansion of cultivation in tropical regions. Here we report the cloning and 
      characterization of J, the major classical locus conferring the LJ trait, and 
      identify J as the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). J 
      depends genetically on the legume-specific flowering repressor E1, and J protein 
      physically associates with the E1 promoter to downregulate its transcription, 
      relieving repression of two important FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes and promoting 
      flowering under short days. Our findings identify an important new component in 
      flowering-time control in soybean and provide new insight into soybean adaptation 
      to tropical regions.

AB  - Adaptive changes in plant phenology are often considered to be a feature of the 
      so-called 'domestication syndrome' that distinguishes modern crops from their 
      wild progenitors, but little detailed evidence supports this idea. In soybean, a 
      major legume crop, flowering time variation is well characterized within 
      domesticated germplasm and is critical for modern production, but its importance 
      during domestication is unclear. Here, we identify sequential contributions of 
      two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, to ancient 
      flowering time adaptation, and demonstrate that they act via LHY homologs to 
      promote expression of the legume-specific E1 gene and delay flowering under long 
      photoperiods. We show that Tof12-dependent acceleration of maturity accompanied a 
      reduction in dormancy and seed dispersal during soybean domestication, possibly 
      predisposing the incipient crop to latitudinal expansion. Better understanding of 
      this early phase of crop evolution will help to identify functional variation 
      lost during domestication and exploit its potential for future crop improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The timing of flowering has a direct impact on successful 
      seed production in plants. Flowering of soybean (Glycine max) is controlled by 
      several E loci, and previous studies identified the genes responsible for the 
      flowering loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. However, natural variation in these genes has 
      not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were the identification of new 
      alleles, establishment of allele diagnoses, examination of allelic combinations 
      for adaptability, and analysis of the integrated effect of these loci on 
      flowering. METHODS: The sequences of these genes and their flanking regions were 
      determined for 39 accessions by primer walking. Systematic discrimination among 
      alleles was performed using DNA markers. Genotypes at the E1-E4 loci were 
      determined for 63 accessions covering several ecological types using DNA markers 
      and sequencing, and flowering times of these accessions at three sowing times 
      were recorded. KEY RESULTS: A new allele with an insertion of a long interspersed 
      nuclear element (LINE) at the promoter of the E1 locus (e1-re) was identified. 
      Insertion and deletion of 36 bases in the eighth intron (E2-in and E2-dl) were 
      observed at the E2 locus. Systematic discrimination among the alleles at the 
      E1-E3 loci was achieved using PCR-based markers. Allelic combinations at the 
      E1-E4 loci were found to be associated with ecological types, and about 62-66 % 
      of variation of flowering time could be attributed to these loci. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study advances understanding of the combined roles of the E1-E4 loci in 
      flowering and geographic adaptation, and suggests the existence of unidentified 
      genes for flowering in soybean.

LID - 10.1093/jxb/erw283 [doi]
AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an important floral integrator whose functions are 
      conserved across plant species. In soybean, two orthologs, FT2a and FT5a, play a 
      major role in initiating flowering. Their expression in response to different 
      photoperiods is controlled by allelic combinations at the maturity loci E1 to E4, 
      generating variation in flowering time among cultivars. We determined the 
      molecular basis of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flowering time in linkage 
      group J (Chromosome 16). Fine-mapping delimited the QTL to a genomic region of 
      107kb that harbors FT5a We detected 15 DNA polymorphisms between parents with the 
      early-flowering (ef) and late-flowering (lf) alleles in the promoter region, an 
      intron, and the 3' untranslated region of FT5a, although the FT5a coding regions 
      were identical. Transcript abundance of FT5a was higher in near-isogenic lines 
      for ef than in those for lf, suggesting that different transcriptional activities 
      or mRNA stability caused the flowering time difference. Single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) calling from re-sequencing data for 439 cultivated and wild 
      soybean accessions indicated that ef is a rare haplotype that is distinct from 
      common haplotypes including lf The ef allele at FT5a may play an adaptive role at 
      latitudes where early flowering is desirable.

AB  - Photoperiodism is a rhythmic change of sensitivity to light, which helps plants 
      to adjust flowering time according to seasonal changes in daylength and to adapt 
      to growing conditions at various latitudes. To reveal the molecular basis of 
      photoperiodism in soybean (Glycine max), a facultative short-day plant, we 
      analyzed the transcriptional profiles of the maturity gene E1 family and two 
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) orthologs (FT2a and FT5a). E1, a repressor for FT2a and 
      FT5a, and its two homologs, E1-like-a (E1La) and E1Lb, exhibited two peaks of 
      expression in long days. Using two different approaches (experiments with 
      transition between light and dark phases and night-break experiments), we 
      revealed that the E1 family genes were expressed only during light periods and 
      that their induction after dawn in long days required a period of light before 
      dusk the previous day. In the cultivar Toyomusume, which lacks the E1 gene, 
      virus-induced silencing of E1La and E1Lb up-regulated the expression of FT2a and 
      FT5a and led to early flowering. Therefore, E1, E1La, and E1Lb function similarly 
      in flowering. Regulation of E1 and E1L expression by light was under the control 
      of E3 and E4, which encode phytochrome A proteins. Our data suggest that 
      phytochrome A-mediated transcriptional induction of E1 and its homologs by light 
      plays a critical role in photoperiodic induction of flowering in soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana), with homologs that encode florigens in many plant species regardless 
      of the type of photoperiodic response. We identified 10 FT homologs, which were 
      arranged as five pairs of linked genes in different homoeologous chromosomal 
      regions, in soybean (Glycine max), a paleopolyploid species. Two of the FT 
      homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, were highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) 
      conditions (inductive for flowering in soybean) and had diurnal expression 
      patterns with the highest expression 4 h after dawn. Under long-day (LD) 
      conditions, expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a was down-regulated and did not follow 
      a diurnal pattern. Flowering took much longer to initiate under LD than under SD, 
      and only the GmFT5a transcript accumulated late in development under LD. Ectopic 
      expression analysis in Arabidopsis confirmed that both GmFT2a and GmFT5a had the 
      same function as Arabidopsis FT, but the effect of GmFT5a was more prominent. A 
      double-mutant soybean line for two PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) genes expressed high 
      levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a under LD, and it flowered slightly earlier under LD 
      than the wild type grown under SD. The expression levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a 
      were regulated by the PHYA-mediated photoperiodic regulation system, and the 
      GmFT5a expression was also regulated by a photoperiod-independent system in LD. 
      Taken together, our results suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a coordinately control 
      flowering and enable the adaptation of soybean to a wide range of photoperiodic 
      environments.

AB  - Gene duplication provides resources for novel gene functions. Identification of 
      the amino acids responsible for functional conservation and divergence of 
      duplicated genes will strengthen our understanding of their evolutionary course. 
      Here, we conducted a systemic functional investigation of 
      phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins (PEBPs) in soybean (Glycine max) and 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrated that after the ancestral 
      duplication, the lineage of the common ancestor of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and 
      TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) subfamilies functionally diverged from the MOTHER OF FT 
      AND TFL1 (MFT) subfamily to activate flowering and repress flowering, 
      respectively. They also underwent further specialization after subsequent 
      duplications. Although the functional divergence increased with duplication age, 
      we observed rapid functional divergence for a few pairs of young duplicates in 
      soybean. Association analysis between amino acids and functional variations 
      identified critical amino acid residues that led to functional differences in 
      PEBP members. Using transgenic analysis, we validated a subset of these 
      differences. We report clear experimental evidence for the functional evolution 
      of the PEBPs in the MFT, FT, and TFL1 subfamilies, which predate the origin of 
      angiosperms. Our results highlight the role of amino acid divergence in driving 
      evolutionary novelty after duplication.

TI  - EARLY FLOWERING 5 acts as a floral repressor in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 664-72
AB  - EARLY FLOWERING 5 (ELF5) is a single-copy gene involved in flowering time 
      regulation in Arabidopsis. ELF5 encodes a nuclear-targeted protein that is 
      related to the human nuclear protein containing a WW domain (Npw)38-binding 
      protein (NpwBP). Lesions in ELF5 cause early flowering in both long days and 
      short days. elf5 mutations partially suppress the late flowering of both 
      autonomous-pathway mutants and FRIGIDA (FRI)-containing lines by reducing the 
      expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a floral repressor upon which many of the 
      flowering pathways converge. elf5 mutations also partially suppress 
      photoperiod-pathway mutants, and this, along with the ability of elf5 mutations 
      to cause early flowering in short days, indicates that ELF5 also affects 
      flowering independently of FLC.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional 
      adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day 
      conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss 
      of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes 
      involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield 
      potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait 
      loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic 
      approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity 
      genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the 
      photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the 
      importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components 
      have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: 
      E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this 
      network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating 
      photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental 
      understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used 
      for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.

AB  - Soybean flowering and maturation are strictly regulated by photoperiod. 
      Photoperiod-sensitive soybean varieties can undergo flowering reversion when 
      switched from short-day (SD) to long-day (LD) conditions, suggesting the presence 
      of a 'floral-inhibitor' under LD conditions. We combined gene expression 
      profiling with a study of transgenic plants and confirmed that GmFT1a, soybean 
      Flowering Locus T (FT) homolog, is a floral inhibitor. GmFT1a is expressed 
      specifically in leaves, similar to the flowering-promoting FT homologs GmFT2a/5a. 
      However, in Zigongdongdou (ZGDD), a model variety for studying flowering 
      reversion, GmFT1a expression was induced by LD but inhibited by SD conditions. 
      This was unexpected, as it is the complete opposite of the expression of 
      flowering promoters GmFT2a/5a. Moreover, the key soybean maturity gene E1 may 
      up-regulate GmFT1a expression. It is also notable that GmFT1a expression was 
      conspicuously high in late-flowering varieties. Transgenic overexpression of 
      GmFT1a delayed flowering and maturation in soybean, confirming that GmFT1a 
      functions as a flowering inhibitor. This discovery highlights the complex impacts 
      of the functional diversification of the FT gene family in soybean, and implies 
      that antagonism between flowering-inhibiting and flowering-promoting FT homologs 
      in this highly photoperiod-sensitive plant may specify vegetative vs reproductive 
      development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CO and FT orthologs, belonging to the BBX and PEBP family, 
      respectively, have important and conserved roles in the photoperiod regulation of 
      flowering time in plants. Soybean genome experienced at least three rounds of 
      whole genome duplications (WGDs), which resulted in multiple copies of about 75% 
      of genes. Subsequent subfunctionalization is the main fate for paralogous gene 
      pairs during the evolutionary process. RESULTS: The phylogenic relationships 
      revealed that CO orthologs were widespread in the plant kingdom while FT 
      orthologs were present only in angiosperms. Twenty-eight CO homologous genes and 
      twenty-four FT homologous genes were gained in the soybean genome. Based on the 
      collinear relationship, the soybean ancestral CO ortholog experienced three WGD 
      events, but only two paralogous gene pairs (GmCOL1/2 and GmCOL5/13) survived in 
      the modern soybean. The paralogous gene pairs, GmCOL1/2 or GmCOL5/13, showed 
      similar expression patterns in pair but different between pairs, indicating that 
      they functionally diverged. GmFTL1 to 7 were derived from the same ancestor prior 
      to the whole genome triplication (WGT) event, and after the Legume WGD event the 
      ancestor diverged into two branches, GmFTL3/5/7 and GmFTL1/2/4/6. GmFTL7 were 
      truncated in the N-terminus compared to other FT-lineage genes, but ubiquitously 
      expressed. Expressions of GmFTL1 to 6 were higher in leaves at the flowering 
      stage than that at the seedling stage. GmFTL3 was expressed at the highest level 
      in all tissues except roots at the seedling stage, and its circadian pattern was 
      different from the other five ones. The transcript of GmFTL6 was highly 
      accumulated in seedling roots. The circadian rhythms of GmCOL5/13 and 
      GmFT1/2/4/5/6 were synchronized in a day, demonstrating the complicate 
      relationship of CO-FT regulons in soybean leaves. Over-expression of GmCOL2 did 
      not rescue the flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis co mutant. However, ectopic 
      expression of GmCOL5 did rescue the co mutant phenotype. All GmFTL1 to 6 showed 
      flower-promoting activities in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS: After three recent 
      rounds of whole genome duplications in the soybean, the paralogous genes of CO-FT 
      regulons showed subfunctionalization through expression divergence. Then, only 
      GmCOL5/13 kept flowering-promoting activities, while GmFTL1 to 6 contributed to 
      flowering control. Additionally, GmCOL5/13 and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 showed similar 
      circadian expression profiles. Therefore, our results suggested that GmCOL5/13 
      and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 formed the complicate CO-FT regulons in the photoperiod 
      regulation of flowering time in soybean.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular mechanisms of flowering and maturity is 
      important for improving the adaptability and yield of seed crops in different 
      environments. In soybean, a facultative short-day plant, genetic variation at 
      four maturity genes, E1 to E4, plays an important role in adaptation to 
      environments with different photoperiods. However, the molecular basis of natural 
      variation in time to flowering and maturity is poorly understood. Using a cross 
      between early-maturing soybean cultivars, we performed a genetic and molecular 
      study of flowering genes. The progeny of this cross segregated for two maturity 
      loci, E1 and E9. The latter locus was subjected to detailed molecular analysis to 
      identify the responsible gene. RESULTS: Fine mapping, sequencing, and expression 
      analysis revealed that E9 is FT2a, an ortholog of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T. 
      Regardless of daylength conditions, the e9 allele was transcribed at a very low 
      level in comparison with the E9 allele and delayed flowering. Despite identical 
      coding sequences, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms and 
      insertions/deletions were detected in the promoter, untranslated regions, and 
      introns between the two cultivars. Furthermore, the e9 allele had a 
      Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon, SORE-1, inserted in the first intron. Comparison 
      of the expression levels of different alleles among near-isogenic lines and 
      photoperiod-insensitive cultivars indicated that the SORE-1 insertion attenuated 
      FT2a expression by its allele-specific transcriptional repression. SORE-1 was 
      highly methylated, and did not appear to disrupt FT2a RNA processing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The soybean maturity gene E9 is FT2a, and its recessive allele 
      delays flowering because of lower transcript abundance that is caused by 
      allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of SORE-1. The 
      FT2a transcript abundance is thus directly associated with the variation in 
      flowering time in soybean. The e9 allele may maintain vegetative growth in 
      early-flowering genetic backgrounds, and also be useful as a long-juvenile 
      allele, which causes late flowering under short-daylength conditions, in 
      low-latitude regions.

AB  - The major maturity gene E1 has the most prominent effect on flowering time and 
      photoperiod sensitivity of soybean, but the pathway mediated by E1 is largely 
      unknown. Here, we found the expression of GmFT4, a homolog of Flowering Locus T, 
      was strongly up-regulated in transgenic soybean overexpressing E1, whereas 
      expression of flowering activators, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, was suppressed. GmFT4 
      expression was strongly up-regulated by long days exhibiting a diurnal rhythm, 
      but down-regulated by short days. Notably, the basal expression level of GmFT4 
      was elevated when transferred to continous light, whereas repressed when 
      transferred to continuous dark. GmFT4 was primarily expressed in fully expanded 
      leaves. Transcript abundance of GmFT4 was significantly correlated with that of 
      functional E1, as well as flowering time phenotype in different cultivars. 
      Overexpression of GmFT4 delayed the flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis. 
      Taken together, we propose that GmFT4 acts downstream of E1 and functions as a 
      flowering repressor, and the balance of two antagonistic factors (GmFT4 vs 
      GmFT2a/5a) determines the flowering time of soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is the key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana), and its homologs encode florigens in many plant species 
      regardless of their photoperiodic response. Two FT homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, 
      are involved in photoperiod-regulated flowering and coordinately control 
      flowering in soybean. However, the molecular and genetic understanding of the 
      roles played by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean 
      is very limited. In this study, we demonstrated that GmFT2a and GmFT5a were able 
      to promote early flowering in soybean by overexpressing these two genes in the 
      soybean cultivar Williams 82 under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. The 
      soybean homologs of several floral identity genes, such as GmAP1, GmSOC1 and 
      GmLFY, were significantly upregulated by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in a redundant and 
      differential pattern. A bZIP transcription factor, GmFDL19, was identified as 
      interacting with both GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and this interaction was confirmed by 
      yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The 
      overexpression of GmFDL19 in soybean caused early flowering, and the 
      transcription levels of the flowering identity genes were also upregulated by 
      GmFDL19, as was consistent with the upregulation of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. The 
      transcription of GmFDL19 was also induced by GmFT2a. The results of the 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that GmFDL19 was able to 
      bind with the cis-elements in the promoter of GmAP1a. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a redundantly and differentially control 
      photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean through both physical interaction with 
      and transcriptional upregulation of the bZIP transcription factor GmFDL19, 
      thereby inducing the expression of floral identity genes.

AB  - The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a highly conserved florigen gene among 
      flowering plants. Soybean genome encodes six homologs of FT, which display 
      flowering activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their contributions to 
      flowering time in different soybean cultivars, especially in field conditions, 
      are unclear. We employed six soybean cultivars with different maturities to 
      extensively investigate expression patterns of GmFTLs (Glycine max FT-like) and 
      GmCOLs (Glycine max CO-like) in the field conditions. The results show that 
      GmFTL3 is an FT homolog with the highest transcript abundance in soybean, but 
      other GmFTLs may also contribute to flower induction with different extents, 
      because they have more or less similar expression patterns in developmental-, 
      leaf-, and circadian-specific modes. And four GmCOL genes (GmCOL1/2/5/13) may 
      confer to the expression of GmFTL genes. Artificial manipulation of GmFTL 
      expression by transgenic strategy (overexpression and RNAi) results in a distinct 
      change in soybean flowering time, indicating that GmFTLs not only impact on the 
      control of flowering time, but have potential applications in the manipulation of 
      photoperiodic adaptation in soybean. Additionally, transgenic plants show that 
      GmFTLs play a role in formation of the first flowers and in vegetative growth.

AB  - Photosensitivity plays an essential role in the response of plants to their 
      changing environments throughout their life cycle. In soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
      Merrill], several associations between photosensitivity and maturity loci are 
      known, but only limited information at the molecular level is available. The FT3 
      locus is one of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time that 
      corresponds to the maturity locus E3. To identify the gene responsible for this 
      QTL, a map-based cloning strategy was undertaken. One phytochrome A gene 
      (GmPhyA3) was considered a strong candidate for the FT3 locus. Allelism tests and 
      gene sequence comparisons showed that alleles of Misuzudaizu (FT3/FT3; JP28856) 
      and Harosoy (E3/E3; PI548573) were identical. The GmPhyA3 alleles of Moshidou 
      Gong 503 (ft3/ft3; JP27603) and L62-667 (e3/e3; PI547716) showed weak or complete 
      loss of function, respectively. High red/far-red (R/FR) long-day conditions 
      enhanced the effects of the E3/FT3 alleles in various genetic backgrounds. 
      Moreover, a mutant line harboring the nonfunctional GmPhyA3 flowered earlier than 
      the original Bay (E3/E3; PI553043) under similar conditions. These results 
      suggest that the variation in phytochrome A may contribute to the complex systems 
      of soybean flowering response and geographic adaptation.

AB  - Flowering is indicative of the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, 
      a critical event in the life cycle of plants. In soybean (Glycine max), a 
      flowering quantitative trait locus, FT2, corresponding to the maturity locus E2, 
      was detected in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the varieties 
      "Misuzudaizu" (ft2/ft2; JP28856) and "Moshidou Gong 503" (FT2/FT2; JP27603). A 
      map-based cloning strategy using the progeny of a residual heterozygous line 
      (RHL) from the RIL was employed to isolate the gene responsible for this 
      quantitative trait locus. A GIGANTEA ortholog, GmGIa (Glyma10g36600), was 
      identified as a candidate gene. A common premature stop codon at the 10th exon 
      was present in the Misuzudaizu allele and in other near isogenic lines (NILs) 
      originating from Harosoy (e2/e2; PI548573). Furthermore, a mutant line harboring 
      another premature stop codon showed an earlier flowering phenotype than the 
      original variety, Bay (E2/E2; PI553043). The e2/e2 genotype exhibited elevated 
      expression of GmFT2a, one of the florigen genes that leads to early flowering. 
      The effects of the E2 allele on flowering time were similar among NILs and 
      constant under high (43 degrees N) and middle (36 degrees N) latitudinal regions in Japan. These 
      results indicate that GmGIa is the gene responsible for the E2 locus and that a 
      null mutation in GmGIa may contribute to the geographic adaptation of soybean.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering, a plant response to seasonal photoperiod changes in the 
      control of reproductive transition, is an important agronomic trait that has been 
      a central target of crop domestication and modern breeding programs. However, our 
      understanding about the molecular mechanisms of photoperiodic flowering 
      regulation in crop species is lagging behind. To better understand the regulatory 
      gene networks controlling photoperiodic flowering of soybeans, we elucidated 
      global gene expression patterns under different photoperiod regimes using the 
      near isogenic lines (NILs) of maturity loci (E loci). Transcriptome signatures 
      identified the unique roles of the E loci in photoperiodic flowering and a set of 
      genes controlled by these loci. To elucidate the regulatory gene networks 
      underlying photoperiodic flowering regulation, we developed the network inference 
      algorithmic package CausNet that integrates sparse linear regression and Granger 
      causality heuristics, with Gaussian approximation of bootstrapping to provide 
      reliability scores for predicted regulatory interactions. Using the transcriptome 
      data, CausNet inferred regulatory interactions among soybean flowering genes. 
      Published reports in the literature provided empirical verification for several 
      of CausNet's inferred regulatory interactions. We further confirmed the inferred 
      regulatory roles of the flowering suppressors GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b using GmCOL1 
      RNAi transgenic soybean plants. Combinations of the alleles of GmCOL1 and the 
      major maturity locus E1 demonstrated positive interaction between these genes, 
      leading to enhanced suppression of flowering transition. Our work provides novel 
      insights and testable hypotheses in the complex molecular mechanisms of 
      photoperiodic flowering control in soybean and lays a framework for de novo 
      prediction of biological networks controlling important agronomic traits in 
      crops.

AB  - The general concept of photoperiodism, i.e., the photoperiodic induction of 
      flowering, was established by Garner and Allard (1920). The genetic factor 
      controlling flowering time, maturity, or photoperiodic responses was observed in 
      soybean soon after the discovery of the photoperiodism. E1, E2, and E3 were named 
      in 1971 and, thereafter, genetically characterized. At the centennial celebration 
      of the discovery of photoperiodism in soybean, we recount our endeavors to 
      successfully decipher the molecular bases for the major maturity loci E1, E2, and 
      E3 in soybean. Through systematic efforts, we successfully cloned the E3 gene in 
      2009, the E2 gene in 2011, and the E1 gene in 2012. Recently, successful 
      identification of several circadian-related genes such as PRR3a, LUX, and J has 
      enriched the known major E1-FTs pathway. Further research progresses on the 
      identification of new flowering and maturity-related genes as well as coordinated 
      regulation between flowering genes will enable us to understand profoundly 
      flowering gene network and determinants of latitudinal adaptation in soybean.

AB  - Adaptation of soybean cultivars to the photoperiod in which they are grown is 
      critical for optimizing plant yield. However, despite its importance, only the 
      major loci conferring variation in flowering time and maturity of US soybean have 
      been isolated. By contrast, over 200 genes contributing to floral induction in 
      the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana have been described. In this work, 
      putative alleles of a library of soybean orthologs of these Arabidopsis flowering 
      genes were tested for their latitudinal distribution among elite US soybean lines 
      developed in the United States. Furthermore, variants comprising the alleles of 
      genes with significant differences in latitudinal distribution were assessed for 
      amino acid conservation across disparate genera to infer their impact on gene 
      function. From these efforts, several candidate genes from various biological 
      pathways were identified that are likely being exploited toward adaptation of US 
      soybean to various maturity groups.

AB  - As major environment factors, drought or high salinity affect crop growth, 
      development and yield. Transgenic approach is an effective way to improve abiotic 
      stress tolerance of crops. In this study, we comparatively analyzed gene 
      structures, genome location, and the evolution of syntaxin proteins containing 
      late embryogenesis abundant (LEA2) domain. GmSYP24 was identified as a 
      dehydration-responsive gene. Our study showed that the GmSYP24 protein was 
      located on the cell membrane. The overexpression of GmSYP24 (GmSYP24ox) in 
      soybean and heteroexpression of GmSYP24 (GmSYP24hx) in Arabidopsis exhibited 
      insensitivity to osmotic/drought and high salinity. However, wild type soybean, 
      Arabidopsis, and the mutant of GmSYP24 homologous gene of Arabidopsis were 
      sensitive to the stresses. Under the abiotic stresses, transgenic soybean plants 
      had greater water content and higher activities of POD, SOD compared with 
      non-transgenic controls. And the leaf stomatal density and opening were reduced 
      in transgenic Arabidopsis. The sensitivity to ABA was decreased during seed 
      germination of GmSYP24ox and GmSYP24hx. GmSYP24hx induced up-regulation of 
      ABA-responsive genes. GmSYP24ox alters the expression of some aquaporins under 
      osmotic/drought, salt, or ABA treatment. These results demonstrated that GmSYP24 
      played an important role in osmotic/drought or salt tolerance in ABA signal 
      pathway.

AB  - The vitamin E family includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are essential 
      lipid-soluble antioxidants necessary for human and livestock health. The seeds of 
      many plant species, including maize, have high gamma (gamma)-tocopherol but low alpha 
      (alpha)-tocopherol contents; however, alpha-tocopherol is the most effective antioxidant. 
      Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the tocopherol composition in plants. 
      alpha-Tocopherol is synthesized from gamma-tocopherol by gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase 
      (gamma-TMT, VTE4) in the final step of the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway. In the 
      present study, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of gamma-TMT was isolated from 
      Zea mays, named ZmTMT. The ZmTMT CDS was 1059 bp in size, encoding 352 amino 
      acids. Recombinant ZmTMT was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified 
      protein effectively converted gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol in vitro. A 
      comparison of enzyme activities showed that the activity of ZmTMT was higher than 
      that of GmTMT2a (Glycine max) and AtTMT (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overexpression of 
      ZmTMT increased the alpha-tocopherol content 4-5-fold in transgenic Arabidopsis and 
      around 6.5-fold in transgenic maize kernels, and increased the alpha-/gamma-tocopherol 
      ratio to approximately 15 and 17, respectively. These results show that it is 
      feasible to overexpress ZmTMT to optimize the tocopherol composition in maize; 
      such a corn product might be useful in the feed industry in the near future.

AB  - Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) carrying the Rj2 allele restricts nodulation 
      with specific Bradyrhizobium strains via host immunity, mediated by rhizobial 
      type III secretory protein NopP and the host resistance protein Rj2. Here we 
      found that the single isoleucine residue I490 in Rj2 is required for induction of 
      symbiotic incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigated the geographical 
      distribution of the Rj2-genotype soybean in a large set of germplasm by single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using a SNP marker for I490. By allelic 
      comparison of 79 accessions in the Japanese soybean mini-core collection, we 
      suggest substitution of a single amino acid residue (R490 to I490) in Rj2 induces 
      symbiotic incompatibility with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 122. The 
      importance of I490 was verified by complementation of rj2-soybean by the dominant 
      allele encoding the Rj2 protein containing I490 residue. The Rj2 allele was also 
      found in Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of G. max, and their single amino acid 
      polymorphisms were associated with the Rj2-nodulation phenotype. By SNP 
      genotyping against 1583 soybean accessions, we detected the Rj2-genotype in 5.4% 
      of G. max and 7.7% of G. soja accessions. Distribution of the Rj2-genotype 
      soybean plants was relatively concentrated in the temperate Asian region. These 
      results provide important information about the mechanism of host 
      genotype-specific symbiotic incompatibility mediated by host immunity and suggest 
      that the Rj2 gene has been maintained by environmental conditions during the 
      process of soybean domestication.

AB  - Using a whole-genome-sequencing approach to explore germplasm resources can serve 
      as an important strategy for crop improvement, especially in investigating wild 
      accessions that may contain useful genetic resources that have been lost during 
      the domestication process. Here we sequence and assemble a draft genome of wild 
      soybean and construct a recombinant inbred population for 
      genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotypic analyses to identify multiple QTLs 
      relevant to traits of interest in agriculture. We use a combination of de novo 
      sequencing data from this work and our previous germplasm re-sequencing data to 
      identify a novel ion transporter gene, GmCHX1, and relate its sequence 
      alterations to salt tolerance. Rapid gain-of-function tests show the protective 
      effects of GmCHX1 towards salt stress. This combination of whole-genome de novo 
      sequencing, high-density-marker QTL mapping by re-sequencing and functional 
      analyses can serve as an effective strategy to unveil novel genomic information 
      in wild soybean to facilitate crop improvement.

AB  - Mutagenesis is a useful tool in many crop species to induce heritable genetic 
      variability for trait improvement and gene discovery. In this study, forward 
      screening of a soybean fast neutron (FN) mutant population identified an 
      individual that produced seed with nearly twice the amount of sucrose (8.1% on 
      dry matter basis) and less than half the amount of oil (8.5% on dry matter basis) 
      as compared to wild type. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA), comparative genomic 
      hybridization, and genome resequencing were used to associate the seed 
      composition phenotype with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 
      13. In a backcross population, the translocation perfectly cosegregated with the 
      seed composition phenotype and exhibited non-Mendelian segregation patterns. We 
      hypothesize that the translocation is responsible for the altered seed 
      composition by disrupting a beta-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase 1 (KASI) 
      ortholog. KASI is a core fatty acid synthesis enzyme that is involved in the 
      conversion of sucrose into oil in developing seeds. This finding may lead to new 
      research directions for developing soybean cultivars with modified carbohydrate 
      and oil seed composition.

AB  - Soybean is an important oilseed crop and major dietary protein resource, yet the 
      molecular processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of seed 
      storage substances are not fully understood. The B3 domain transcription factor 
      (TF) LEC2 essentially regulates embryo development and seed maturation in other 
      plants, but is not functionally characterized in soybean. Here, we characterize 
      the function of a soybean LEC2 homolog, GmLEC2a, in regulating carbohydrate 
      catabolism, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, and seed development. The 
      experimental analysis showed that GmLEC2a complemented Arabidopsis atlec2 mutant 
      defects in seedling development and TAG accumulation. Over-expression of GmLEC2a 
      in Arabidopsis seeds increased the TAG contents by 34% and the composition of 
      long chain fatty acids by 4% relative to the control seeds. Transcriptome 
      analysis showed that ectopic expression of GmLEC2a in soybean hairy roots 
      up-regulated several sets of downstream TF genes GmLEC1, GmFUS3, GmABI3, GmDof11 
      and GmWRI1 that regulate the seed development and production of seed storage 
      substances. GmLEC2a regulated the lipid transporter genes and oil body protein 
      gene OLEOSIN (OLE1). The genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis and storage, 
      such as sucrose synthesis, and catabolism of TAG, such as lipases in GmLEC2a 
      hairy roots were down-regulated. GmLEC2a targeted metabolic genes for seed 
      protein in soybean.

AB  - There are substantial genotypic differences in the levels of flavonol glycosides 
      (FGs) in soybean leaves. The first objective of this study was to identify and 
      locate genes responsible for FG biosynthesis in the soybean genome. The second 
      objective was to clone and verify the function of these candidate genes. 
      Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed by crossing the Kitakomachi and 
      Koganejiro cultivars. The FGs were separated by high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and identified. The FGs of Koganejiro had rhamnose at the 
      6''-position of the glucose or galactose bound to the 3-position of kaempferol, 
      whereas FGs of Kitakomachi were devoid of rhamnose. Among the 94 RILs, 53 RILs 
      had HPLC peaks classified as Koganejiro type, and 41 RILs had peaks classified as 
      Kitakomachi type. The segregation fitted a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that a single 
      gene controls FG composition. SSR analysis, linkage mapping and genome database 
      survey revealed a candidate gene in the molecular linkage group O (chromosome 
      10). The coding region of the gene from Koganejiro, designated as GmF3G6''Rt-a, is 
      1,392 bp long and encodes 464 amino acids, whereas the gene of Kitakomachi, 
      GmF3G6''Rt-b, has a two-base deletion resulting in a truncated polypeptide 
      consisting of 314 amino acids. The recombinant GmF3G6''Rt-a protein converted 
      kaempferol 3-O-glucoside to kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside and utilized 
      3-O-glucosylated/galactosylated flavonols and UDP-rhamnose as substrates. 
      GmF3G6''Rt-b protein had no activity. These results indicate that GmF3G6''Rt 
      encodes a flavonol 3-O-glucoside (1 --> 6) rhamnosyltransferase and it probably 
      corresponds to the Fg2 gene. GmF3G6''Rt was designated as UGT79A6 by the UGT 
      Nomenclature Committee.

AB  - Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of glycerophospholipids 
      to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) and a free headgroup. PLDs are important for 
      plant growth, development, and responses to external stresses. However, their 
      roles in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis are still unclear. Here, we report that 
      a soybean (Glycine max) PLDgamma (GmPLDgamma) is involved in glycerolipid turnover and 
      seed oil production. GmPLDgamma was targeted to mitochondria and exhibited PLD 
      activity that was activated by oleate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
      [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)]. Overexpression of GmPLDgamma (abbreviated GmPLDgamma-OE) in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in enhanced seed weight, elevated levels of TAGs 
      with 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon fatty acids (FAs), and altered oil-body morphology. 
      Furthermore, the levels of membrane lipids in vegetative tissues decreased 
      significantly, whereas no overt changes were found in mature seeds except for a 
      decrease in the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) level in the GmPLDgamma-OE lines. 
      Additionally, the expression of genes involved in glycerolipid metabolism was 
      significantly upregulated in developing siliques in GmPLDgamma-OE lines. Together, 
      our data indicate a regulatory role for GmPLDgamma in TAG synthesis and fatty-acid 
      remodeling, highlighting the importance of mitochondria-directed 
      glycerophospholipid homeostasis in seed oil accumulation.

AB  - Tocochromanol, or vitamin E, plays a crucial role in human and animal nutrition 
      and is synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. gamma-Tocopherol 
      methyltransferase (gamma-TMT), one of the key enzymes in the tocopherol biosynthetic 
      pathway in plants, converts gamma, delta-tocopherols into alpha-, beta-tocopherols. Tocopherol 
      content was investigated in 15 soybean cultivars and GmTMT2 was isolated from 
      five varieties based on tocopherol content. GmTMT2a was expressed in E. coli and 
      the purified protein effectively converted gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol in 
      vitro. Overexpression of GmTMT2a enhanced alpha-tocopherol content 4-6-fold in 
      transgenic Arabidopsis, and alpha-tocopherol content increased 3-4.5-fold in 
      transgenic maize seed, which correlated with the accumulation of GmTMT2a. 
      Transgenic corn that is alpha-tocopherol-rich may be beneficial for animal health and 
      growth.

AB  - GmTMT transgenic maize is a genetically modified maize plant that overexpresses 
      the gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT) from Glycine max (Gm). The gamma-TMT gene 
      was introduced into maize line Zhen58 to encode the GmTMT2a protein which can 
      convert gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol. Overexpression of GmTMT2a significantly 
      increased the alpha-tocopherol content in transgenic maize. The present study was 
      designed to investigate any potential effects of GmTMT maize grain in a 90-day 
      subchronic rodent feeding study. Maize grains from GmTMT or Zhen58 were 
      incorporated into rodent diets at low (12.5%), medium (25%) or high (50%) 
      concentrations and administered to Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10/sex/group) for 90 
      days. The negative control group of rats (n = 10/sex/group) were fed with common 
      maize diets. Results from body weights, feed consumption, clinical chemistry, 
      hematology, absolute and relative organ weights indicated no treatment-related 
      side effects of GmTMT maize grain on rats in comparison with rats consuming diets 
      containing Zhen58 maize grain. In addition, no treatment-related changes were 
      found in necropsy and histopathology examinations. Altogether, our data indicates 
      that GmTMT transgenic maize is as safe and nutritious as its conventional 
      non-transgenic maize.

AB  - Shoot branching is fundamentally important in determining soybean yield. Here, 
      through genome-wide association study, we identify one predominant association 
      locus on chromosome 18 that confers soybean branch number in the natural 
      population. Further analyses determine that Dt2 is the corresponding gene and the 
      natural variations in Dt2 result in significant differential transcriptional 
      levels between the two major haplotypes. Functional characterization reveals that 
      Dt2 interacts with GmAgl22 and GmSoc1a to physically bind to the promoters of 
      GmAp1a and GmAp1d and to activate their transcription. Population genetic 
      investigation show that the genetic differentiation of Dt2 display significant 
      geographic structure. Our study provides a predominant gene for soybean branch 
      number and may facilitate the breeding of high-yield soybean varieties.

TI  - Dt2 is a gain-of-function MADS-domain factor gene that specifies semideterminacy 
      in soybean.

AB  - Similar to Arabidopsis thaliana, the wild soybeans (Glycine soja) and many 
      cultivars exhibit indeterminate stem growth specified by the shoot identity gene 
      Dt1, the functional counterpart of Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1). Mutations 
      in TFL1 and Dt1 both result in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) switching from 
      vegetative to reproductive state to initiate terminal flowering and thus produce 
      determinate stems. A second soybean gene (Dt2) regulating stem growth was 
      identified, which, in the presence of Dt1, produces semideterminate plants with 
      terminal racemes similar to those observed in determinate plants. Here, we report 
      positional cloning and characterization of Dt2, a dominant MADS domain factor 
      gene classified into the APETALA1/SQUAMOSA (AP1/SQUA) subfamily that includes 
      floral meristem (FM) identity genes AP1, FUL, and CAL in Arabidopsis. Unlike AP1, 
      whose expression is limited to FMs in which the expression of TFL1 is repressed, 
      Dt2 appears to repress the expression of Dt1 in the SAMs to promote early 
      conversion of the SAMs into reproductive inflorescences. Given that Dt2 is not 
      the gene most closely related to AP1 and that semideterminacy is rarely seen in 
      wild soybeans, Dt2 appears to be a recent gain-of-function mutation, which has 
      modified the genetic pathways determining the stem growth habit in soybean.

AB  - The plasma membrane (PM)-localized receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important 
      roles in pathogen defense. One of the first cloned RLKs is the Arabidopsis 
      receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2), which specifically recognizes a 
      conserved 22 amino acid N-terminal sequence of Pseudomonas syringae pv．tomato 
      DC3000 (Pst) flagellin protein (flg22). Although extensively studied in 
      Arabidopsis, the functions of RLKs in crop plants remain largely uninvestigated. 
      To understand the roles of RLKs in soybean (Glycine max), GmFLS2 was silenced via 
      virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) mediated by Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). No 
      significant morphological differences were observed between GmFLS2-silenced 
      plants and the vector control plants. However, silencing GmFLS2 significantly 
      enhanced the susceptibility of the soybean plants to Pseudomonas syringae 
      pv．glycinea (Psg). Kinase activity assay showed that silencing GmFLS2 
      significantly reduced the phosphorylation level of GmMPK6 in response to flg22 
      treatment. However, reduced phosphorylation level of both GmMPK3 and GmMPK6 in 
      response to Psg infection was observed in GmFLS2-silenced plants, implying that 
      defense response is likely transduced through activation of the downstream GmMAPK 
      signaling pathway upon recognition of bacterial pathogen by GmFLS2. The core 
      peptides of flg22 from Pst and Psg were highly conserved and only 4 amino acid 
      differences were seen at their N-termini. Interestingly, it appeared that the 
      Psg-flg22 was more effective in activating soybean MAPKs than activating 
      Arabidopsis MAPKs, and conversely, Pst-flg22 was more effective in activating 
      Arabidopsis MAPKs than activating soybean MAPKs, suggesting that the cognate 
      recognition is more potent than heterologous recognition in activating downstream 
      signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that the function of FLS2 is 
      conserved in immunity against bacteria pathogens across different plant species.

AB  - Enhanced disease susceptibility1 (EDS1) and phytoalexin deficient4 (PAD4) are 
      well-known regulators of both basal and resistance (R) protein-mediated plant 
      defense. We identified two EDS1-like (GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b) proteins and one PAD4-like 
      (GmPAD4) protein that are required for resistance signaling in soybean (Glycine 
      max). Consistent with their significant structural conservation to Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) counterparts, constitutive expression of GmEDS1 or GmPAD4 
      complemented the pathogen resistance defects of Arabidopsis eds1 and pad4 
      mutants, respectively. Interestingly, however, the GmEDS1 and GmPAD4 did not 
      complement pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation in the eds1/pad4 
      mutants. Furthermore, the GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b proteins were unable to complement the 
      turnip crinkle virus coat protein-mediated activation of the Arabidopsis R 
      protein Hypersensitive reaction to Turnip crinkle virus (HRT), even though both 
      interacted with HRT. Silencing GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b or GmPAD4 reduced basal and 
      pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation and enhanced soybean 
      susceptibility to virulent pathogens. The GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b and GmPAD4 genes were 
      also required for Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea2 (Rpg2)-mediated 
      resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Notably, the GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b proteins 
      interacted with the cognate bacterial effector AvrA1 and were required for its 
      virulence function in rpg2 plants. Together, these results show that despite 
      significant structural similarities, conserved defense signaling components from 
      diverse plants can differ in their functionalities. In addition, we demonstrate a 
      role for GmEDS1 in regulating the virulence function of a bacterial effector.

AB  - ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and its interacting partner, PHYTOALEXIN 
      DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), constitute a regulatory hub that is essential for basal 
      resistance to invasive biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens. EDS1 and PAD4 
      are also recruited by Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type nucleotide 
      binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins to signal isolate-specific pathogen 
      recognition. Recent work points to a fundamental role of EDS1 and PAD4 in 
      transducing redox signals in response to certain biotic and abiotic stresses. 
      These intracellular proteins are important activators of salicylic acid (SA) 
      signaling and also mediate antagonism between the jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene 
      (ET) defense response pathways. EDS1 forms several molecularly and spatially 
      distinct complexes with PAD4 and a newly discovered in vivo signaling partner, 
      SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 101 (SAG101). Together, EDS1, PAD4 and SAG101 provide 
      a major barrier to infection by both host-adapted and non-host pathogens.

AB  - Photoperiod is one of the main climatic factors that determine flowering time and 
      yield. Some members of the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) transcription factor family 
      have been reported to be involved in regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis, 
      maize, and rice. In this study, the domain analysis showed that GmIDD had a 
      typical ID domain and was a member of the soybean IDD transcription factor 
      family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that GmIDD was induced by 
      short day conditions in leaves and regulated by circadian clock. Under long day 
      conditions, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing GmIDD flowered earlier than 
      wild-type, and idd mutants flowered later, while the overexpression of GmIDD 
      rescued the late-flowering phenotype of idd mutants. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of GmIDD binding sites in 
      GmIDD-overexpression (GmIDD-ox) Arabidopsis further identified potential direct 
      targets, including a transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 18 (AGL18). GmIDD might 
      inhibit the transcriptional activity of flower repressor AGL18 by binding to the 
      TTTTGGTCC motif of AGL18 promoter. Furthermore, the results also showed that 
      GmIDD overexpression increased the transcription levels of flowering time-related 
      genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), 
      LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) in Arabidopsis. Taken together, GmIDD appeared to 
      inhibit the transcriptional activity of AGL18 and induced the expression of FT 
      gene to promote Arabidopsis flowering.

AB  - The soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] chlorophyll-deficient line MinnGold is a 
      spontaneous mutant characterized by yellow foliage. Map-based cloning and 
      transgenic complementation revealed that the mutant phenotype is caused by a 
      nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the third exon of a Mg-chelatase subunit 
      gene (ChlI1a) on chromosome 13. This gene was selected as a candidate for a 
      different yellow foliage mutant, T219H (Y11y11), that had been previously mapped 
      to chromosome 13. Although the phenotypes of MinnGold and T219H are clearly 
      distinct, sequencing of ChlI1a in T219H identified a different nonsynonymous 
      mutation in the third exon, only six base pairs from the MinnGold mutation. This 
      information, along with previously published allelic tests, were used to identify 
      and clone a third yellow foliage mutation, CD-5, which was previously mapped to 
      chromosome 15. This mutation was identified in the ChlI1b gene, a paralog of 
      ChlI1a. Sequencing of the ChlI1b allele in CD-5 identified a nonsynonymous 
      substitution in the third exon that confers an identical amino acid change as the 
      T219H substitution at ChlI1a. Protein sequence alignments of the two Mg-chelatase 
      subunits indicated that the sites of amino acid modification in MinnGold, T219H, 
      and CD-5 are highly conserved among photosynthetic species. These results suggest 
      that amino acid alterations in this critical domain may create competitive 
      inhibitory interactions between the mutant and wild-type ChlI1a and ChlI1b 
      proteins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is the most prevalent viral disease in 
      many soybean production areas. Due to a large number of SMV resistant loci and 
      alleles, SMV strains and the rapid evolution in avirulence/effector genes, 
      traditional breeding for SMV resistance is complex. Genetic engineering is an 
      effective alternative method for improving SMV resistance in soybean. Potassium 
      (K+) is the most abundant inorganic solute in plant cells, and is involved in 
      plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Studies have shown that altering 
      the level of K+ status can reduce the spread of the viral diseases. Thus K+ 
      transporters are putative candidates to target for soybean virus resistance. 
      RESULTS: The addition of K+ fertilizer significantly reduced SMV incidence. 
      Analysis of K+ channel gene expression indicated that GmAKT2, the ortholog of 
      Arabidopsis K+ weak channel encoding gene AKT2, was significantly induced by SMV 
      inoculation in the SMV highly-resistant genotype Rsmv1, but not in the 
      susceptible genotype Ssmv1. Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing GmAKT2 were 
      produced and verified by Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis. Analysis of K+ 
      concentrations on different leaves of both the transgenic and the wildtype 
      (Williams 82) plants revealed that overexpression of GmAKT2 significantly 
      increased K+ concentrations in young leaves of plants. In contrast, K+ 
      concentrations in the old leaves of the GmAKT2-Oe plants were significantly lower 
      than those in WT plants. These results indicated that GmAKT2 acted as a K+ 
      transporter and affected the distribution of K+ in soybean plants. Starting from 
      14 days after inoculation (DAI) of SMV G7, severe mosaic symptoms were observed 
      on the WT leaves. In contrast, the GmAKT2-Oe plants showed no symptom of SMV 
      infection. At 14 and 28 DAI, the amount of SMV RNA in WT plants increased 200- 
      and 260- fold relative to GmAKT2-Oe plants at each time point. Thus, SMV 
      development was significantly retarded in GmAKT2-overexpressing transgenic 
      soybean plants. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of GmAKT2 significantly enhanced SMV 
      resistance in transgenic soybean. Thus, alteration of K+ transporter expression 
      is a novel molecular approach for enhancing SMV resistance in soybean.

AB  - Soybean is a typical short-day crop, and its photoperiodic and gibberellin (GA) 
      responses for the control of flowering are critical to seed yield. The GmGBP1 
      mRNA abundance in leaves was dramatically increased in short-days (SDs) compared 
      to that in long-days in which it was consistently low at all time points from 0 
      to 6 days (days after transfer to SDs). GmGBP1 was highly expressed in leaves and 
      exhibited a circadian rhythm in SDs. Ectopic overexpression of GmGBP1 in tobaccos 
      caused photoperiod-insensitive early flowering by increasing NtCO mRNA levels. 
      GmGBP1 mRNA abundance was also increased by GAs. Transgenic GmGBP1 overexpressing 
      (-ox) tobacco plants exhibited increased GA signaling-related phenotypes 
      including flowering and plant height promotion. Furthermore, the hypocotyl 
      elongation, early-flowering and longer internode phenotypes were largely 
      accelerated by GA3 application in the GmGBP1-ox tobacco seedlings. Being 
      consistent, overexpression of GmGBP1 resulted in significantly enhanced GA 
      signaling (evidenced suppressed expression of NtGA20ox) both with and without GA 
      treatments. GmGBP1 was a positive regulator of both photoperiod and GA-mediated 
      flowering responses. In addition, GmGBP1-ox tobaccos were hypersensitive to ABA, 
      salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination. Heat-inducible GmGBP1 also 
      enhanced thermotolerance in transgenic GmGBP1-ox tobaccos during seed germination 
      and growth. GmGBP1 protein was localized in the nucleus. Analyses of a series of 
      5'-deletions of the GmGBP1 promoter suggested that several cis-acting elements, 
      including P-BOX, TCA-motif and three HSE elements necessary to induce gene 
      expression by GA, salicic acid and heat stress, were specifically localized in 
      the GmGBP1 promoter region.

AB  - Soybean yield is largely dependent on growth period. We characterized two growth 
      period quantitative trait loci, Gp11 and Gp12, from a recombinant inbred 
      population generated from a cross of wild (W05) and cultivated (C08) soybean. 
      Lines carrying Gp11C08 and Gp12C08 tend to have a shorter growth period and 
      higher expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. Furthermore, multiple interval mapping 
      suggests that Gp11 and Gp12 may be genetically interacting with the E2 locus. 
      This is consistent with the observation that GmFT2a and GmFT5a are activated by 
      Gp11C08 and Gp12C08 at ZT4 in the recessive e2 but not the dominant E2 
      background. Gp11 and Gp12 are duplicated genomic regions each containing a copy 
      of the soybean ortholog of PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 3 (GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B). 
      GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B from C08 carry mutations that delete the CCT domain in the 
      encoded proteins. These mutations were selected during soybean improvement and 
      they alter the subcellular localization of GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B. Furthermore, 
      GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B can interact with TOPLESS-related transcription factors, 
      suggesting that they function in a transcription repressor complex. This study 
      addresses previously unexplored components of the genetic network that probably 
      controls the growth period of soybean and puts these loci into context with the 
      well-characterized growth period-regulating E loci.

AB  - Copy number variations (CNVs) play important roles in crop domestication. 
      However, there is only very limited information on the involvement of CNVs in 
      soybean domestication. Trailing growth and long shoots are soybean adaptations 
      for natural habitats but cause lodging that hampers yield in cultivation. 
      Previous studies have focused on Dt1/2 affecting the indeterminate/determinate 
      growth habit, whereas the possible role of the gibberellin pathway remained 
      unclear. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of a 
      recombinant inbred population of 460 lines revealed a 
      trailing-growth-and-shoot-length QTL. A CNV region within this QTL was 
      identified, featuring the apical bud-expressed gibberellin 2-oxidase 8A/B, the 
      copy numbers of which were positively correlated with expression levels and 
      negatively with trailing growth and shoot length, and their effects were 
      demonstrated by transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the 
      fixation index, this CNV region underwent intense selection during the initial 
      domestication process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SKIP is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. It can regulate 
      plant stress tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis. But the homolog of SKIP protein 
      in soybean has been not reported up to now. RESULTS: In this study, the 
      expression patterns of soybean GAMYB binding protein gene (GmGBP1) encoding a 
      homolog of SKIP protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and 
      different day lengths. The expression of GmGBP1 was induced by polyethyleneglycol 
      6000, NaCl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress. GmGBP1 had 
      transcriptional activity in C-terminal. GmGBP1 could interact with R2R3 domain of 
      GmGAMYB1 in SKIP domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. In 
      long-day (16 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic 
      overexpression of GmGBP1 exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette 
      leaves; Suppression of AtSKIP in Arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering 
      delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes (CONSTANS, FLOWERING 
      LOCUS T, LEAFY); Arabidopsis myb33 mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of 
      GmGBP1 showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. In short-day (8 
      h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with GmGBP1 flowered later and 
      showed a higher level of FLOWERING LOCUS C compared with wild type. When treated 
      with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of 
      GmGBP1 enhanced the tolerances to heat and drought stresses but reduced the 
      tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several 
      stress-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In Arabidopsis, GmGBP1 might positively 
      regulate the flowering time by affecting CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and 
      GAMYB directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in LDs, 
      but GmGBP1 might represse flowering by affecting FLOWERING LOCUS C and SHORT 
      VEGETATIVE PHASE in autonomous pathway in SDs. GmGBP1 might regulate the activity 
      of ROS-eliminating to improve the resistance to heat and drought but reduce the 
      high-salinity tolerance.

AB  - The present study screened for polymorphisms in coding and non-coding regions of 
      the GmGBP1 gene in 278 soybean accessions with variable maturity and growth habit 
      characteristics under natural field conditions in three different latitudes in 
      China. The results showed that the promoter region was highly diversified 
      compared with the coding sequence of GmGBP1. Five polymorphisms and four 
      haplotypes were closely related to soybean flowering time and maturity through 
      association and linkage disequilibrium analyses. Varieties with the polymorphisms 
      SNP_-796G, SNP_-770G, SNP_-307T, InDel_-242normal, SNP_353A, or haplotypes Hap-3 
      and Hap-4 showed earlier flowering time and maturity in different environments. 
      The shorter growth period might be largely due to higher GmGBP1 expression levels 
      in soybean that were caused by the TCT-motif with SNP_-796G in the promoter. In 
      contrast, the lower expression level of GmGBP1 in soybean caused by RNAi 
      interference of GmGBP1 resulted in a longer growth period under different day 
      lengths. Furthermore, the gene interference of GmGBP1 also caused a reduction in 
      photoperiod response sensitivity (PRS) before flowering in soybean. RNA-seq 
      analysis on GmGBP1 underexpression in soybean showed that 94 and 30 predicted 
      genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Of these, 
      the diurnal photoperiod-specific expression pattern of three significant 
      flowering time genes GmFT2a, GmFT5a, and GmFULc also showed constantly lower mRNA 
      levels in GmGBP1-i soybean than in wild type, especially under short day 
      conditions. Together, the results showed that GmGBP1 functioned as a positive 
      regulator upstream of GmFT2a and GmFT5a to activate the expression of GmFULc to 
      promote flowering on short days.

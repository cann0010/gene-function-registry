  - FAD2-1A
gene_symbol_long: Fatty Acid Disaturase 2-1A
gene_model_pub_name:
  - Glyma10g278000 (this seems to have more support, but both appear in SoyBase!)
  - Glyma10g42470
gene_model_full_id:
  - glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.10G278000
  - glyma.Wm82.gnm1.ann1.Glyma10g42470
confidence: 4
curators:
  - Marlene Dorneich-Hayes
comments:
  - Knockout studies confirm that functional FAD2-1A decreases accumulation of oleic acid in seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: Normal FAD2-1A converts the precursors of oleic acid into linoleic acid. If FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B are both downregulated or have loss-of-function mutations, seeds will have high oleic acid content.

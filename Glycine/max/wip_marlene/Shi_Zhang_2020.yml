  - GmDRR1
gene_symbol_long: Glycine max disease resistance-responsive gene 1
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma.11g150400
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.11G150400
confidence: 3
comments: 
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established though overexpression (which increased the number of nodules). RNA interference had no effect on nodule number. GmDRR1, GmDRR2, and GmDRR3 are duplicates.
phenotype_synopsis: Induced by the presence of rhizobia and involved in establishing symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. 
traits:
  - entity_name: nodulation
    entity: GO:0009877
  - entity_name: biological process involved in symbiotic interaction
    entity: GO:0044403
  - entity_name: disease resistance
    entity: TO:0000112

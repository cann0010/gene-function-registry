comments:
  - Overexpression of STF3 increased nodulation, RNAi knockdown decreased nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: STF3 promotes nodulation by inducing expression of nodule signalling pathway 1 (NSP1), nodule inception (NIN), and nuclear factor Y (NFY) genes. STF3 is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor CRY1 and expressed mainly in leaves. The protein product of STF3 migrates from shoots to roots. Next, it is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase (CCaMK), which is activated by rhizobial infection. Phosphorylation causes STF3 and FT2a to form a complex.

comments:
  - Overexpression of 2a increased nodulation while RNAi knockdown decreased nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: FT2a is known for stimulating flowering but it also stimulates nodulation. It is induced by the transcription factors GmCRY1 and CONSTANS. It is mainly expressed in leaves and migrates from shoots to roots. There, the product of FT2a forms a complex with the phosphorylated product of STF3.

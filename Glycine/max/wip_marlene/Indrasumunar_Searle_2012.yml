  - GmNFR1α
gene_symbol_long: Nod Factor Receptor 1α
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma02G270800
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.02G270800
confidence: 5
curators:
  - Marlene Dorneich-Hayes
comments:
  - Mutants lacking NFR1α don't form nodules.
  - Transgenic overexpression increased the number of nodules per plant and allowed plants to form nodules in unfavorable conditions.
phenotype_synopsis: NFR1α codes for a receptor kinase which positively regulates nodule number.

curators:

comments:
  - Mutants with functional NFR1β but nonfunctional NFR1α have very minimal nodulation.
  - Overexpression of NFR1β did not increase nodule number.
  - Expression of NFR1β is not sufficient to induce a healthy level of nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: NFR1β codes for a redundant receptor kinase with unstable mRNA transcripts.

comments:
  - The effect of bZIP123 was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis, not soy.
  - Overexpression of bZIP123 increases lipid content in transgenic Arabidopsis as well as upregulating the genes that bZIP123 acts on.
phenotype_synopsis: bZIP123 is a transcription factor which promotes expression of sucrose transporter and cell wall invertase genes.

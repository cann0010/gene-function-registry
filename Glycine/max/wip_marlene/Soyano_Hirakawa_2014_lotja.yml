comments:
  - Ectopic expression of NIN produces extra nodule-like structures but, in the presence of nitrate, downregulates genes needed to establish symbiosis.
  - Constitutive expression of NIN eventually leads to suppression of NIN and stops further nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis:
  - NIN is part of a negative feedback loop.
  - It codes for a transcription factor which induces nodulation by promoting cortical cell division.
  - It also activates genes which code for the NIN-repressing signal proteins CLE-RS1 and CLE-RS2 which stop nodulation.
  - NIN positively regulates rhizobium infection by inducing the genes necessary to establish symbiosis in the absence of nitrate.

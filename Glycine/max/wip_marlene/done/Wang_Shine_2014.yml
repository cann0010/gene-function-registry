comments:
  - Silencing of GmEDS1a/b and GmPAD4 stopped accumulation of salicylic acid and increased the plant's suceptibility to Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea and soybean mosaic virus infection. The phenotype is only altered if all three genes are silenced.
phenotype_synopsis: responsible for basal and pathogen-inducible accumulation of salicylic acid, which helps the plant resist bacterial, oomycete, and viral infection. Gene activity is induced by infection.

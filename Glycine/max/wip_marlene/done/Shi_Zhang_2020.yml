gene_symbols:
  - GmDRR1
gene_symbol_long: Disease Resistance-Responsive gene 1
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma.11g150400
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.11G150400
confidence: 3
comments:
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established though overexpression (which increased the number of nodules). RNA interference had no effect on nodule number. GmDRR1 is homologous with GmDRR2 and GmDRR3.
phenotype_synopsis: Induced by the presence of rhizobia and involved in establishing symbiotic relationship with rhizobia.

comments:
  - GmDRR1 and GmDRR2 are homologous. The function of GmDRR1 may depend on dimerization with GmDRR2.

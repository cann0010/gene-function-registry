comments:
  - GmPHR1 is expressed throughout nodules and expression increases as nodules develop.
  - Transgenic overexpression increased nodule size and increased the concentration of N and P.
  - GmPHR1 and GmPHR4 promote each other's expression.
  - When phosphorus is abundant, overexpression of GmPHR1 represses GmPHT1-4.
  - GmPHR1 positively regulates GmPAP12 (see Wang, Yang et al., 2020).
phenotype_synopsis: GmPHR1 is a constitutively expressed transcription factor which induces expression of GmPHT1s to promote phosphate uptake. Together, GmPHRs and GmPHT1s maintain inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in nodules.

comments:
  - PHR4 is expressed in noninfected nodule tissues. Transgenic overexpression increased nodule size but decreased nodule number.
  - PHR4 targets PHT1-1, PHT1-4, and PHT1-11.
  - PHR4 and PHR1 promote each other's expression.
  - When Pi is abundant, overexpression of PHR4 increases expression of PHT1-4.
  - Silencing of PHR4 had no effect on PHT1-4 expression.
phenotype_synopsis: PHR4 is a constitutively expressed transcription factor which induces expression of PHT1s to promote phosphate uptake. Together, PHRs and PHT1s maintain inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis in nodules.

comments:
  - PHT1-11 is expressed in noninfected nodule tissues.
  - RNAi silencing of PHT1-11 increased nodule number but decreased nodule size and nitrogenase activity.
  - Transgenic overexpression of PHT1-11 enhanced nitrogenase activity.
  - Expression of PHT1-11 is enhanced by PHR1, except in N2-fixing regions, where PHR1 represses PHT1-11.
  - PHT1-11 is repressed by PHR4.
  - Overexpression of PHT1-11 represses PHT1-4.

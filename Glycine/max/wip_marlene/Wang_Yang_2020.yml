comments:
  - When phosphate (P) is abuntant, overexpression of PAP12 increases nodule number, nitrogenase and phytase activity, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity.
  - When PAP12 is silenced, nodule number and APase activity are reduced.
  - PAP12 is induced by low-P conditions.
  - PAP12 is induced by transcription factor PHR1 (see Lu, Cheng et. al., 2020).
phenotype_synopsis: PAP12 promotes P uptake, efficient P usage, and maintains P homeostasis in nodules under low-P conditions by increasing the activity of APases. It is also involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation.

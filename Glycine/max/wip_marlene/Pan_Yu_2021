comments: 
  - Overexpression of GmABCC8 in transgenic plants created glyphosate resistance. GmABCC8 knockout plants had decreased resistance to glyphosate.
phenotype_synopsis: GmABCC8 codes for an efflux pump that 'extrudes' the herbicide glyphosate out of a cell's cytoplasm, making the plant glyphosate resistant.

comments:
  - Overexpression enhances triacylglycerol biosynthesis in seeds (and in other tissues to a lesser extent). Involved in stress response. Downregulated by cold, insect bites, and jasmonate. It produces similar results when transformed into other species.
phenotype_synopsis: DGAT1A controls synthesis of many triacylglycerols, using 18:3 acyl CoA as an acyl donor. Oil mostly accumulates in seeds.

comments:
  - Researchers studied the phenotypes of loss-of-function mutants and compared them to WT plants.
phenotype_synopsis: GmFATA1a loss-of-function mutatants accumulate high concentrations of oleic acid in their seeds. GmFATA1a is an acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase that hydrolizes 18:1 acyl-acyl carrier proteins.

  - CRISPR-Cas9 knockout study on genes identified in other species.
phenotype_synopsis: FATB1a codes for an enzyme that hydrolizes saturated acyl-ACPs. It is most strongly expressed in seeds and leaves. Knockouts have low palmitic and stearic acid but high oleic and linoleic acid.

comments:
  - TIR1A is strongly expressed in developing nodules, main and lateral roots, and especially in main root tips and lateral root primordia.
  - Expression in roots decreases as nodulation progresses.
  - TIR1A is upregulated by auxin.
phenotype_synopsis: TIR1A is an auxin receptor which positively regulates root growth and nodulation.

comments:
  - AFB3a is most strongly expressed in developing nodules, main and lateral roots, and especially in main root tips and lateral root primordia.
  - AFB3a is upregulated by the presence of auxin but downregulated by miR393d.
  - RNAi knockdowns of AFB3a have reduced nodulation.
  - Transgenic overexpression of AFB3a did not increase nodulation.

confidence: 4
comments: 
  - Transgenic overexpression of DMI1 reduces Heterodera glycines parasitism and increases nodulation. RNAi silencing of DMI1 increases suceptibility to H. glycines and reduces nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: DMI genes confer resistance to H. glycines nematodes and are necessary for establishing symbiosis. DMI1 encodes a channel protein that controls the signalling pathway leading to nodulation.

   - Transgenic overexpression of DMI2 reduces Heterodera glycines parasitism and increases nodulation even without rhizobia. RNAi silencing of DMI2 increases suceptibility to H. glycines and reduces nodulation.
 phenotype_synopsis: DMI genes confer resistance to H. glycines nematodes and are necessary for establishing symbiosis. DMI2 encodes a kinase.

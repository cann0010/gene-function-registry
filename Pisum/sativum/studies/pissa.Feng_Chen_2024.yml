comments:
  - 100kb deletion upstream of ChlG generates aberrant transcripts and confers the yellow pod phenotype
  - yellow pods are not the only feature of gp mutants, yellow tissues are seen in the petiole, rachis, tendrils and leaflet midribs of young leaves, and also in the pedicel, peduncle and sepals
  - even the green leaves of gp lines have disturbed development of thylakoid membranes
  - 100kb deletion removes three entire genes, as well as part of exon5 and the whole of exon 6 from a gene encoding a TIR-NBS-LRR protein
  - the deletion upstream of ChlG in the gp lines generates a fused NLR-ChlG transcript, removing the fused NLR-ChlG transcript would restore the wild-type green pod color

  - The insertion of Ips-r, a 1021bp non-autonomous Ac- like transposable element, within exon 22 
  - The single GWAS peak indicates that there is no genetic heterogeneity associated with this phenotype within the lines studied

comments:
  - Two classes of i alleles i-1 and i-2
  - SGR encodes Mg-dechelatase
  - i-1 is caused by a insertion of a 5,696 nt TAR element (a Ty1-Copia LTR retrotransposon)
  - i-2 is a novel 408 bp deletion in the promoter of the Mg-dechelatase gene

  - bHLH transcription factor required for the expression of chalcone synthase in epidermal tissues which enables anthocyanin pigmentation
  - two most common a alleles had splice donor site variant (G to A) in Hap 5 or a additional ‘A’ nucleotide in exon 6 creating a premature stop codon in Hap 2

comments:
  - reduced height le variants were exclusively found in haplotype 1, which carries the known G-A substitution at chr5:639901919
  - variation at other known loci involved in plant height, or internode length does not contribute significantly to natural phenotypic variation in this trait
